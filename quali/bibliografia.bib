abstract="We developed a composite machine-learning based algorithm, called ANGLOR, to predict real-value protein backbone torsion angles from amino acid sequences. The input features of ANGLOR include sequence profiles, predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility. In a large-scale benchmarking test, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the phi/psi prediction is 28 degrees/46 degrees , which is approximately 10\% lower than that generated by software in literature. The prediction is statistically different from a random predictor (or a purely secondary-structure-based predictor) with p-value <1.0 x 10(-300) (or <1.0 x 10(-148)) by Wilcoxon signed rank test. For some residues (ILE, LEU, PRO and VAL) and especially the residues in helix and buried regions, the MAE of phi angles is much smaller (10-20 degrees ) than that in other environments. Thus, although the average accuracy of the ANGLOR prediction is still low, the portion of the accurately predicted dihedral angles may be useful in assisting protein fold recognition and ab initio 3D structure modeling.",

The error rate of all algorithms is greatly reduced by using statistical scores to evaluate matches rather than percentage identity or raw scores. The E-value statistical scores of SSEARCH and FASTA are reliable: the number of false positives found in our tests agrees well with the scores reported. However, the P-values reported by BLAST and WU-BLAST2 exaggerate significance by orders of magnitude. SSEARCH, FASTA ktup = 1, and WU-BLAST2 perform best, and they are capable of detecting almost all relationships between proteins whose sequence identities are >30\%. For more distantly related proteins, they do much less well; only one-half of the relationships between proteins with 20-30\% identity are found. Because many homologs have low sequence similarity, most distant relationships cannot be detected by any pairwise comparison method; however, those which are identified may be used with confidence.",

abstract="As methods for determining protein three-dimensional (3D) structure develop, a continuing problem is how to verify that the final protein model is correct. The revision of several protein models to correct errors has prompted the development of new criteria for judging the validity of X-ray and NMR structures, as well as the formation of energetic and empirical methods to evaluate the correctness of protein models. The challenge is to distinguish between a mistraced or wrongly folded model, and one that is basically correct, but not adequately refined. We show that an effective test of the accuracy of a 3D protein model is a comparison of the model to its own amino-acid sequence, using a 3D profile, computed from the atomic coordinates of the structure 3D profiles of correct protein structures match their own sequences with high scores. In contrast, 3D profiles for protein models known to be wrong score poorly. An incorrectly modelled segment in an otherwise correct structure can be identified by examining the profile score in a moving-window scan. The accuracy of a protein model can be assessed by its 3D profile, regardless of whether the model has been derived by X-ray, NMR or computational procedures.",

abstract="Much attention is being paid to protein databases as an important information source for proteome research. Although used extensively for similarity searches, protein databases themselves have not fully been characterized. In a systematic attempt to reveal protein-database characters that could contribute to revealing how protein chains are constructed, frequency distributions of all possible combinatorial sets of three, four, and five amino acids (``triplets,'' ``quartets,'' and ``pentats''; collectively called constituent sequences) have been examined in the nonredundant (nr) protein database, demonstrating the existence of nonrandom bias in their ``availability'' at the population level. Nonexistent short sequences of pentats were found that showed low availability in biological proteins against their expected probabilities of occurrence. Among them, six representative ones were successfully synthesized as peptides with reasonably high yields in a conventional Fmoc method, excluding the possibility that a putative physicochemical energy barrier in forming them could be a direct cause for the low availability. They were also expressed as soluble fusion proteins in a conventional Escherichia coli BL21Star(DE3) system with reasonably high yield, again excluding a possible difficulty in their biological synthesis. Together, these results suggest that information on three-dimensional structures and functions of proteins exists in the context of connections of short constituent sequences, and that proteins are composed of evolutionarily selected constituent sequences, which are reflected in their availability differences in the database. These results may have biological implications for protein structural studies.",

Here, we describe a computational method that estimates the extent of optimization for affinity and specificity of amino acids at a protein-DNA interface based on the crystal structure of the complex, by modeling the changes in binding-free energy associated with all individual amino acid and base substitutions at the interface. The extent to which residues are predicted to be optimal for specificity versus affinity varies within a given protein-DNA interface and between different complexes, and in many cases recapitulates previous experimental observations. The approach provides a complement to traditional methods of mutational analysis, and should be useful for rapidly formulating hypotheses about the roles of amino acid residues in protein-DNA interfaces.",

abstract="Formation of beta-hairpins is considered the initial step of folding of many proteins and, consequently, peptides constituting the beta-hairpin sequence of proteins (the beta-hairpin-forming peptides) are considered as models of early stages of protein folding. In this article, we discuss the results of experimental studies (circular-dichroism, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry) of the structure of beta-hairpin-forming peptides excised from the B1 domain of protein G, which are known to fold on their own. We demonstrate that local interactions at the turn sequence and hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar residues are the dominant structure-determining factors, while there is no convincing evidence that stable backbone hydrogen bonds are formed in these peptides in aqueous solution. Consequently, the most plausible mechanism for folding of the beta-hairpin sequence appears to be the broken-zipper mechanism consisting of the following three steps: (i) bending the chain at the turn sequence owing to favorable local interactions, (ii) formation of loose hydrophobic contacts between nonpolar residues, which occur close to the contacts in the native structure of the protein but not exactly in the same position and, finally, (iii) formation of backbone hydrogen bonds and locking the hydrophobic contacts in the native positions as a hydrophobic core develops, sufficient to dehydrate the backbone peptide groups. This mechanism provides sufficient uniqueness (contacts form between residues that become close together because the chain is bent at the turn position) and robustness (contacts need not occur at once in the native positions) for folding a beta-hairpin sequence.",

abstract="RosettaDock has been increasingly used in protein docking and design strategies in order to predict the structure of protein-protein interfaces. Here we test capabilities of RosettaDock 3.2, part of the newly developed Rosetta v3.2 modeling suite, against Docking Benchmark 3.0, and compare it with RosettaDock v2.3, the latest version of the previous Rosetta software package. The benchmark contains a diverse set of 116 docking targets including 22 antibody-antigen complexes, 33 enzyme-inhibitor complexes, and 60 'other' complexes. These targets were further classified by expected docking difficulty into 84 rigid-body targets, 17 medium targets, and 14 difficult targets. We carried out local docking perturbations for each target, using the unbound structures when available, in both RosettaDock v2.3 and v3.2. Overall the performances of RosettaDock v2.3 and v3.2 were similar. RosettaDock v3.2 achieved 56 docking funnels, compared to 49 in v2.3. A breakdown of docking performance by protein complex type shows that RosettaDock v3.2 achieved docking funnels for 63\% of antibody-antigen targets, 62\% of enzyme-inhibitor targets, and 35\% of 'other' targets. In terms of docking difficulty, RosettaDock v3.2 achieved funnels for 58\% of rigid-body targets, 30\% of medium targets, and 14\% of difficult targets. For targets that failed, we carry out additional analyses to identify the cause of failure, which showed that binding-induced backbone conformation changes account for a majority of failures. We also present a bootstrap statistical analysis that quantifies the reliability of the stochastic docking results. Finally, we demonstrate the additional functionality available in RosettaDock v3.2 by incorporating small-molecules and non-protein co-factors in docking of a smaller target set. This study marks the most extensive benchmarking of the RosettaDock module to date and establishes a baseline for future research in protein interface modeling and structure prediction.",

abstract="Reconstructing a protein in three dimensions from its backbone torsion angles is an ongoing challenge because minor inaccuracies in these angles produce major errors in the structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm, the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Even accurate knowledge of the backbone torsions and Psi is insufficient, owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, also lead to major errors in the structure. Against this background, we conducted a computational experiment to assess whether protein conformation can be determined from highly approximate backbone torsion angles, the kind of information that is now obtained readily from NMR. Specifically, backbone torsion angles were taken from proteins of known structure and mapped into 60 degrees x 60 degrees grid squares, called mesostates. Side-chain atoms beyond the beta -carbon were discarded. A mesostate representation of the protein backbone was then used to extract likely candidates from a fragment library of mesostate pentamers, followed by Monte Carlo-based fragment-assembly simulations to identify stable conformations compatible with the given mesostate sequence. Only three simple energy terms were used to gauge stability: molecular compaction, soft-sphere repulsion, and hydrogen bonding. For the six representative proteins described here, stable conformers can be partitioned into a remarkably small number of topologically distinct clusters. Among these, the native topology is found with high frequency and can be identified as the cluster with the most favorable energy.",

We calculate an entropy value for each protease subpocket based on sequences of cleaved substrates extracted from the MEROPS database. We compare our results with known subpocket specificity profiles for individual proteases and protease groups (e.g. serine proteases, metallo proteases) and reflect them quantitatively. Summation of subpocket-wise cleavage entropy contributions yields a measure for overall protease substrate specificity. This total cleavage entropy allows ranking of different proteases with respect to their specificity, separating unspecific digestive enzymes showing high total cleavage entropy from specific proteases involved in signaling cascades. The development of a quantitative cleavage entropy score allows an unbiased comparison of subpocket-wise and overall protease specificity. Thus, it enables assessment of relative importance of physicochemical and structural descriptors in protease recognition. We present an exemplary application of cleavage entropy in tracing substrate specificity in protease evolution. This highlights the wide range of substrate promiscuity within homologue proteases and hence the heavy impact of a limited number of mutations on individual substrate specificity.",

Important advances are reported in modeling protein-ligand energetics, such as the incorporation of electronic polarization and the use of quantum mechanical methods. Recent calculations suggest that changes in configurational entropy strongly oppose binding and must be included if accurate affinities are to be obtained. The linear interaction energy (LIE) and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods are analyzed, as are free energy pathway methods, which show promise and may be ready for more extensive testing.

Three major programs which automatically determine the location of helices and strands are used for this purpose, namely DSSP, P-Curve and Define. Their results have been compared for a non-redundant database of 154 proteins. On a residue per residue basis, the percentage match score is only 63\% between the three methods. While these methods agree on the overall number of residues in each of the three states (helix, strand or coil), they differ on the number of helices or strands, thus implying a wide discrepancy in the length of assigned structural elements. Moreover, the length distribution of helices and strands points to the existence of artefacts inherent to each assignment algorithm. To overcome these difficulties a consensus assignment is proposed where each residue is assigned to the state determined by at least two of the three methods. With this assignment the artefacts of each algorithm are attenuated. The residues assigned in the same state by the three methods are better predicted than the others. This assignment will thus be useful for analysing the success rate of prediction methods more accurately.",

abstract="Computational design of novel protein-protein interfaces is a test of our understanding of protein interactions and has the potential to allow modification of cellular physiology. Methods for designing high-affinity interactions that adopt a predetermined binding mode have proved elusive, suggesting the need for new strategies that simplify the design process. A solvent-exposed backbone on a $\beta$-strand is thought of as ``sticky'' and $\beta$-strand pairing stabilizes many naturally occurring protein complexes. Here, we computationally redesign a monomeric protein to form a symmetric homodimer by pairing exposed $\beta$-strands to form an intermolecular $\beta$-sheet. A crystal structure of the designed complex closely matches the computational model (rmsd = 1.0 Å). This work demonstrates that $\beta$-strand pairing can be used to computationally design new interactions with high accuracy.",

After affinity maturation, two of the designed proteins, HB36 and HB80, bind H1 and H5 HAs with low nanomolar affinity. Further, HB80 inhibits the HA fusogenic conformational changes induced at low pH. The crystal structure of HB36 in complex with 1918/H1 HA revealed that the actual binding interface is nearly identical to that in the computational design model.

abstract="The pathway which proteins take to fold can be influenced from the earliest events of structure formation. In this light, it was both predicted and confirmed that increasing the stiffness of a beta hairpin turn decreased the size of the transition state ensemble (TSE), while increasing the folding rate. Thus, there appears to be a relationship between conformationally restricting the TSE and increasing the folding rate, at least for beta hairpin turns. In this study, we hypothesize that the enormous sampling necessary to fold even two-state folding proteins in silico could be reduced if local structure constraints were used to restrict structural heterogeneity by polarizing folding pathways or forcing folding into preferred routes. Using a G{\={o}} model, we fold Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 (CI-2) and the src SH3 domain after constraining local sequence windows to their native structure by rigid body dynamics (RBD). Trajectories were monitored for any changes to the folding pathway and differences in the kinetics compared with unconstrained simulations. Constraining local structure decreases folding time two-fold for 41\% of src SH3 windows and 45\% of CI-2 windows. For both proteins, folding times are never significantly increased after constraining any window. Structural polarization of the folding pathway appears to explain these rate increases. Folding rate enhancements are consistent with the goal to reduce sampling time necessary to reach native structures during folding simulations. As anticipated, not all constrained windows showed an equal decrease in folding time. We conclude by analyzing these differences and explain why RBD may be the preferred way to constrain structure.",

abstract="Protein secondary structures have been viewed as fundamental building blocks for protein folding, structure and design. Previous studies indicate that the propensities of individual amino acids to form particular secondary structures are the result of a combination of local conformational preferences and non-local factors. To examine the extent to which non-local factors influence the formation of secondary structural elements, we have designed an 11-amino-acid sequence (dubbed the 'chameleon' sequence) that folds as an alpha-helix when in one position but as a beta-sheet when in another position of the primary sequence of the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). Both proteins, chameleon-alpha and chameleon-beta, are folded into structures similar to native GB1, as judged by several biophysical criteria. Our results demonstrate that non-local interactions can determine the secondary structure of peptide sequences of substantial length. They also support views of protein folding that favour tertiary interactions as dominant determinants of structure.",

This database was implemented in an algorithm based on the helix/coil transition theory (AGADIR). Here, we have modified this algorithm to include previously described local motifs: hydrophobic staple, Schellman motif and Pro-capping motif, new variants of these, and newly described side-chain-side-chain interactions. Based on recent experimental data we have introduced a position dependence of the helical propensities for some of the 20 amino acid residues. A new electrostatic model that takes into consideration all electrostatic interactions up to 12 residues in distance in the helix and random-coil conformations, as well as the effect of ionic strength, has been implemented. We have synthesized and analyzed several peptides, and used data from peptides already analysed by other groups, to test the validity of our electrostatic model. The modified algorithm predicts, with an overall standard deviation value of 6.6 (maximum helix is 100\%), the helical, content of 778 peptides of which 223 correspond to wild-type and modified protein fragments. To improve the prediction potential of the algorithm and to have a direct comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance data, the algorithm now predicts the conformational shift of the CalphaH protons, 13Calpha and 3JalphaN values. We have found that for those peptides correctly predicted from the point of view of circular dichroism, the prediction of the NMR parameters is very good.",

abstract="Fold recognition from sequence can be an important step in protein structure and function prediction. Many methods have tackled this goal. Most of them, based on sequence alignment, fail for sequences of low similarity. Alignment-free approaches can provide an efficient alternative. For such approaches, the identification of efficient fold discriminatory features is critical. We propose a new fold recognition approach that relies on the encoding of the local structure of proteins using a Hidden Markov Model Structural Alphabet. This encoding provides a 1D description of the conformation of complete proteins structures, including loops. At the fold level, compared with the classical secondary structure helix, strand, and coil states, such encoding is expected to provide the means of a better discrimination between loop conformations, hence providing better fold identification. Compared with previous related approaches, this supplement of information results in significant improvement. When combining this information with supplementary information of secondary structure and residue burial, we obtain a fold recognition accuracy of 78\% for 27 protein families, that is, 8\% higher than the best available method so far, and of 68\% for 60 families. Corresponding scores at the class level are of 92\% and 90\% indicating that mispredictions are mostly within structural classes.",

The majority of these peptides have been studied at low temperatures (0 to 10 degrees C), and neutral pH. However, in vivo, proteins fold at higher temperatures and in some cases low or high pH values. To understand protein folding it is necessary to calculate the helical behaviour of linear peptides under very different temperature and pH experimental conditions. We have included the temperature and pH effects on the helical behaviour of peptides by means of generally accepted assumptions and simplifications. The inclusion of these terms allow us to calculate the helical behaviour of polyalanine-based peptides, as well as of complex natural sequences, under different experimental conditions.",

Using AGADIR we have done a rational modification of peptides corresponding to protein secondary structure elements in order to increase their helical content. The circular dichroism analysis of the mutant peptides showed a very good agreement between the experimental and calculated helical content. Moreover, in certain specific cases in which strong tertiary contacts in folded proteins do not exist, the algorithm successfully predicts the length of mutagenised alpha-helices. It is interesting to note that the final values of the parameters used do not significantly differ in absolute terms from those extracted from mutagenesis studies in proteins.

Although these are first steps for the computational design of novel function, crystal structures and biochemical characterization already point out where success and failure are likely in the application of protein design. Contrasting failed and successful design attempts has been used to diagnose deficiencies in the approaches and in the underlying hybrid energy function. In this manner, design provides an inherent mechanism by which crucial information is obtained on pressing areas where focused efforts to improve methods are needed. Of the successful designs, many feature pre-organized sites that are poised to perform their intended function, and improvements often result from disfavoring alternative functionally suboptimal states. These rapid developments and fundamental insights obtained thus far promise to make computational design of novel molecular function general, robust, and routine.",

In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars."

Since June 2000, EVA collected more than 20,000 secondary structure predictions. The EVA sets sufficed to conclude that the field of secondary structure prediction has advanced again. Accuracy increased substantially in the 1990s through using evolutionary information taken from the divergence of proteins in the same structural family. Recently, the evolutionary information resulting from improved searches and larger databases has again boosted prediction accuracy by more than 4\% to its current height around 76\% of all residues predicted correctly in one of the three states: helix, strand, or other. The best current methods solved most of the problems raised at earlier CASP meetings: All good methods now get segments right and perform well on strands. Is the recent increase in accuracy significant enough to make predictions even more useful? We believe the answer is affirmative. What is the limit of prediction accuracy? We shall see.

The maximum theoretical Q3 accuracy for combination of these methods is shown to be 78\%. A simple consensus prediction on the 396 domains, with automatically generated multiple sequence alignments gives an average Q3 prediction accuracy of 72.9\%. This is a 1\% improvement over PHD, which was the best single method evaluated. Segment Overlap Accuracy (SOV) is 75.4\% for the consensus method on the 396-protein set. The secondary structure definition method DSSP defines 8 states, but these are reduced by most authors to 3 for prediction. Application of the different published 8- to 3-state reduction methods shows variation of over 3\% on apparent prediction accuracy. This suggests that care should be taken to compare methods by the same reduction method.

abstract="An important problem in computational biology is predicting the structure of the large number of putative proteins discovered by genome sequencing projects. Fold-recognition methods attempt to solve the problem by relating the target proteins to known structures, searching for template proteins homologous to the target. Remote homologs that may have significant structural similarity are often not detectable by sequence similarities alone. To address this, we incorporated predicted local structure, a generalization of secondary structure, into two-track profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). We did not rely on a simple helix-strand-coil definition of secondary structure, but experimented with a variety of local structure descriptions, following a principled protocol to establish which descriptions are most useful for improving fold recognition and alignment quality. On a test set of 1298 nonhomologous proteins, HMMs incorporating a 3-letter STRIDE alphabet improved fold recognition accuracy by 15\% over amino-acid-only HMMs and 23\% over PSI-BLAST, measured by ROC-65 numbers. We compared two-track HMMs to amino-acid-only HMMs on a difficult alignment test set of 200 protein pairs (structurally similar with 3-24\% sequence identity). HMMs with a 6-letter STRIDE secondary track improved alignment quality by 62\%, relative to DALI structural alignments, while HMMs with an STR track (an expanded DSSP alphabet that subdivides strands into six states) improved by 40\% relative to CE.",

In this study, the entropies and correlations of local structures are first calculated. The results show that neighboring local structures are strongly correlated. Then, a dual-layer model has been designed for protein local structure prediction. The position-specific score matrix, generated by PSI-BLAST, is inputted to the first-layer classifier, whose output is further enhanced by a second-layer classifier. The neural network is selected as the classifier. Two structure alphabets are explored, which are represented in Cartesian coordinate space and in torsion angles space respectively. Testing on the nonredundant dataset shows that the dual-layer model is an efficient method for protein local structure prediction. The Q-scores are 0.456 and 0.585 for the two structure alphabets, which is a significant improvement in comparison with related works.",

An SDE defines a local structural environment of a residue considering the coordinates and the depth of amino acids that locate in the vicinity of the side-chain centroid of the residue. SDEs are general enough that similar SDEs are found in protein structures with globally different folds. Using SDEs, we developed a procedure called PRESCO (Protein Residue Environment SCOre) for selecting native or near-native models from a pool of computational models. The procedure searches similar residue environments observed in a query model against a set of representative native protein structures to quantify how native-like SDEs in the model are.

abstract="The UNited RESidue (UNRES) model of polypeptide chains is a coarse-grained model in which each amino-acid residue is reduced to two interaction sites, namely, a united peptide group (p) located halfway between the two neighboring $\alpha$-carbon atoms (C$\alpha$s), which serve only as geometrical points, and a united side chain (SC) attached to the respective C$\alpha$. Owing to this simplification, millisecond molecular dynamics simulations of large systems can be performed. While UNRES predicts overall folds well, it reproduces the details of local chain conformation with lower accuracy. Recently, we implemented new knowledge-based torsional potentials (Krupa et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2013, 9, 4620--4632) that depend on the virtual-bond dihedral angles involving side chains: C$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}C$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}C$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}SC ($\tau$(1)), SC{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}C$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}C$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}C$\alpha$ ($\tau$(2)), and SC{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}C$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}C$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}SC ($\tau$(3)) in the UNRES force field. These potentials resulted in significant improvement of the simulated structures, especially in the loop regions. In this work, we introduce the physics-based counterparts of these potentials, which we derived from the all-atom energy surfaces of terminally blocked amino-acid residues by Boltzmann integration over the angles $\lambda$(1) and $\lambda$(2) for rotation about the C$\alpha${\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}C$\alpha$ virtual-bond angles and over the side-chain angles $\chi$. The energy surfaces were, in turn, calculated by using the semiempirical AM1 method of molecular quantum mechanics. Entropy contribution was evaluated with use of the harmonic approximation from Hessian matrices. One-dimensional Fourier series in the respective virtual-bond-dihedral angles were fitted to the calculated potentials, and these expressions have been implemented in the UNRES force field. Basic calibration of the UNRES force field with the new potentials was carried out with eight training proteins, by selecting the optimal weight of the new energy terms and reducing the weight of the regular torsional terms. The force field was subsequently benchmarked with a set of 22 proteins not used in the calibration. The new potentials result in a decrease of the root-mean-square deviation of the average conformation from the respective experimental structure by 0.86 {\AA} on average; however, improvement of up to 5 {\AA} was observed for some proteins.",

abstract="The ensemble folding of two 21-residue alpha-helical peptides has been studied using all-atom simulations under several variants of the AMBER potential in explicit solvent using a global distributed computing network. Our extensive sampling, orders of magnitude greater than the experimental folding time, results in complete convergence to ensemble equilibrium. This allows for a quantitative assessment of these potentials, including a new variant of the AMBER-99 force field, denoted AMBER-99 phi, which shows improved agreement with experimental kinetic and thermodynamic measurements. From bulk analysis of the simulated AMBER-99 phi equilibrium, we find that the folding landscape is pseudo-two-state, with complexity arising from the broad, shallow character of the ``native'' and ``unfolded'' regions of the phase space. Each of these macrostates allows for configurational diffusion among a diverse ensemble of conformational microstates with greatly varying helical content and molecular size. Indeed, the observed structural dynamics are better represented as a conformational diffusion than as a simple exponential process, and equilibrium transition rates spanning several orders of magnitude are reported. After multiple nucleation steps, on average, helix formation proceeds via a kinetic ``alignment'' phase in which two or more short, low-entropy helical segments form a more ideal, single-helix structure.",

Whether codon preference is linked to cotranslational regulation of polypeptide folding remains unclear. Here, we derive a revised translational efficiency scale that incorporates the competition between tRNA supply and demand. Applying this scale to ten closely related yeast species, we uncover the evolutionary conservation of codon optimality in eukaryotes. This analysis reveals universal patterns of conserved optimal and nonoptimal codons, often in clusters, which associate with the secondary structure of the translated polypeptides independent of the levels of expression. Our analysis suggests an evolved function for codon optimality in regulating the rhythm of elongation to facilitate cotranslational polypeptide folding, beyond its previously proposed role of adapting to the cost of expression. These findings establish how mRNA sequences are generally under selection to optimize the cotranslational folding of corresponding polypeptides.",

Unlike the focus of the vast research already done on the direct prediction of the final folded conformations, we will model the temporal and dynamic folding process. To reduce the complexity of the interactions and the nature of the amino acid elements, lattice models like HP were used, a model that categorizes the amino acids regarding their hydrophobicity. Taking into account the restrictions of the lattice model, the CA model defines how the amino acids interact through time to obtain a folded conformation. We extended the classical CA models using artificial neural networks for their implementation (neural CA), and we used evolutionary computing to automatically obtain the models by means of Differential Evolution. As the iterative folding also provides the final folded conformation, we can compare the results with those from direct prediction methods of the final protein conformation. Finally, as the neural CA that provides the iterative folding process can be evolved using several protein sequences and used as operators in the folding of another protein with different length, this represents an advantage over the NP-hard complexity of the original problem of the direct prediction.",

abstract="Protein folding is a very complicated and highly cooperative dynamic process. However, the folding kinetics is likely to depend more on a few key structural features. Here we find that secondary structures can determine folding rates of only large, multi-state folding proteins and fails to predict those for small, two-state proteins. The importance of secondary structures for protein folding is ordered as: extended $\beta$ strand > $\alpha$ helix > bend > turn > undefined secondary structure>310 helix > isolated $\beta$ strand > $\pi$ helix. Only the first three secondary structures, extended $\beta$ strand, $\alpha$ helix and bend, can achieve a good correlation with folding rates. This suggests that the rate-limiting step of protein folding would depend upon the formation of regular secondary structures and the buckling of chain. The reduced secondary structure alphabet provides a simplified description for the machine learning applications in protein design.",

We found that 85 of the peptides have no preferred structure, while 48 of them converge to a preferred structure. In 85\% of the converged cases (41 peptides), the structures found by the simulations bear some resemblance to their native structures, based on a coarse-grained backbone description. In particular, all seven of the beta hairpins in the native structures contain a fragment in the turn that is highly structured. In the eight cases where the bioinformatics-based I-sites library picks out native-like structures, the present simulations are largely in agreement. Such physics-based modeling may be useful for identifying early nuclei in folding kinetics and for assisting in protein-structure prediction methods that utilize the assembly of peptide fragments.",

The huge amount of available sequence and structural information provides hints to identify the putative fold for a given sequence. Indeed, protein structures prefer a limited number of local backbone conformations, some being characterized by preferences for certain amino acids. These preferences largely depend on the local structural environment. The prediction of local backbone conformations has become an important factor to correctly identifying the global protein fold.

abstract="FUGUE, a program for recognizing distant homologues by sequence-structure comparison (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/fugue/), has three key features. (1) Improved environment-specific substitution tables. Substitutions of an amino acid in a protein structure are constrained by its local structural environment, which can be defined in terms of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and hydrogen bonding status. The environment-specific substitution tables have been derived from structural alignments in the HOMSTRAD database (http://www-cryst.bioc. cam.ac.uk/homstrad/). (2) Automatic selection of alignment algorithm with detailed structure-dependent gap penalties. FUGUE uses the global-local algorithm to align a sequence-structure pair when they greatly differ in length and uses the global algorithm in other cases. The gap penalty at each position of the structure is determined according to its solvent accessibility, its position relative to the secondary structure elements (SSEs) and the conservation of the SSEs. (3) Combined information from both multiple sequences and multiple structures. FUGUE is designed to align multiple sequences against multiple structures to enrich the conservation/variation information. We demonstrate that the combination of these three key features implemented in FUGUE improves both homology recognition performance and alignment accuracy.",

Comparisons of intrinsic phi, psi propensities with their equivalent secondary structure propensities show that while correlations for helix are relatively weak, those for strand are much stronger.

The GGXGG peptide series is often used as a model of the unstructured denatured state of proteins. The sampling in the peptide MD simulations is neither random nor uniform. Instead, individual amino acids show preferences for particular conformations, but the peptide is dynamic, and interconversion between conformers is facile. For a given amino acid, the (Phi,Psi) distributions in the protein simulations and the Protein Data Bank are very similar and often distinct from those in the peptide simulations. Comparison between the peptide and protein simulations shows that packing constraints, solvation, and the tendency for particular amino acids to be used for specific structural motifs can overwhelm the ``intrinsic propensities'' of amino acids for particular (Phi,Psi) conformations. We also compare our helical propensities with experimental consensus values using the host-guest method, which appear to be determined largely by context and not necessarily the intrinsic conformational propensities of the guest residues. These simulations represent an improved coil library free from contextual effects to better model intrinsic conformational propensities and provide a detailed view of conformations making up the ``random coil'' state.",

Solvent accessibility is a simple model that distinguishes residue environment. The pairwise interactions represent a simple model of local side chain to side chain interactions. To test the importance of these features we developed an algorithm to separate alpha-helices, beta-strands, and ``other'' structure. Single residue and pairwise probabilities were determined for 25,141 samples from proteins with <30\% homology. Combining the features of solvent accessibility with pairwise probabilities allows us to distinguish the three structures after cross validation at the 82.0\% level. We gain 1.4\% to 2.0\% accuracy by optimizing the propensities, demonstrating that probabilities do not necessarily reflect propensities. Optimization of residue exposures, weights of all probabilities, and propensities increased accuracy to 84.0\%.",

abstract="To clarify the physical basis of DNA binding specificity, the thermodynamic properties and DNA binding and bending abilities of the DNA binding domains (DBDs) of sequence-specific (SS) and non-sequence-specific (NSS) HMG box proteins were studied with various DNA recognition sequences using micro-calorimetric and optical methods. Temperature-induced unfolding of the free DBDs showed that their structure does not represent a single cooperative unit but is subdivided into two (in the case of NSS DBDs) or three (in the case of SS DBDs) sub-domains, which differ in stability. Both types of HMG box, most particularly SS, are partially unfolded even at room temperature but association with DNA results in stabilization and cooperation of all the sub-domains. Binding and bending measurements using fluorescence spectroscopy over a range of ionic strengths, combined with calorimetric data, allowed separation of the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the Gibbs energies of DNA binding, yielding their enthalpic and entropic terms and an estimate of their contributions to DNA binding and bending. In all cases electrostatic interactions dominate non-electrostatic in the association of a DBD with DNA. The main difference between SS and NSS complexes is that SS are formed with an enthalpy close to zero and a negative heat capacity effect, while NSS are formed with a very positive enthalpy and a positive heat capacity effect. This indicates that formation of SS HMG box-DNA complexes is specified by extensive van der Waals contacts between apolar groups, i.e. a more tightly packed interface forms than in NSS complexes. The other principal difference is that DNA bending by the NSS DBDs is driven almost entirely by the electrostatic component of the binding energy, while DNA bending by SS DBDs is driven mainly by the non-electrostatic component. The basic extensions of both categories of HMG box play a similar role in DNA binding and bending, making solely electrostatic interactions with the DNA",

abstract="The amino acid sequences of proteins determine their three-dimensional structures and functions. However, how sequence information is related to structures and functions is still enigmatic. In this study, we show that at least a part of the sequence information can be extracted by treating amino acid sequences of proteins as a collection of English words, based on a working hypothesis that amino acid sequences of proteins are composed of short constituent amino acid sequences (SCSs) or ``words''. We first confirmed that the English language highly likely follows Zipf's law, a special case of power law. We found that the rank-frequency plot of SCSs in proteins exhibits a similar distribution when low-rank tails are excluded. In comparison with natural English and ``compressed'' English without spaces between words, amino acid sequences of proteins show larger linear ranges and smaller exponents with heavier low-rank tails, demonstrating that the SCS distribution in proteins is largely scale-free. A distribution pattern of SCSs in proteins is similar among species, but species-specific features are also present. Based on the availability scores of SCSs, we found that sequence motifs are enriched in high-availability sites (i.e., ``key words'') and vice versa. In fact, the highest availability peak within a given protein sequence often directly corresponds to a sequence motif. The amino acid composition of high-availability sites within motifs is different from that of entire motifs and all protein sequences, suggesting the possible functional importance of specific SCSs and their compositional amino acids within motifs. We anticipate that our availability-based word decoding approach is complementary to sequence alignment approaches in predicting functionally important sites of unknown proteins from their amino acid sequences.",

abstract="There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research"

These distinct energetic signatures for major versus minor groove binding are irrespective of the magnitude of DNA bending and/or the extent of binding-induced protein refolding. The primary determinants of their different energetic profiles appear to be the distinct hydration properties of the major and minor grooves; namely, that the water in the A+T-rich minor groove is in a highly ordered state and its removal results in a substantial positive contribution to the binding entropy. Since the entropic forces driving protein binding into the minor groove are a consequence of displacing water ordered by the regular arrangement of polar contacts, they cannot be regarded as hydrophobic.",

abstract="Helix formation is an elementary process in protein folding, influencing both the rate and mechanism of the global folding reaction. Yet, because helix formation is less cooperative than protein folding, the kinetics are often multiexponential, and the observed relaxation times are not straightforwardly related to the microscopic rates for helix nucleation and elongation. Recent ultrafast spectroscopic measurements on the peptide Ac-WAAAH(+)-NH(2) were best fit by two relaxation modes on the ∼0.1-1 ns time scale, (1) apparently much faster than had previously been experimentally inferred for helix nucleation. Here, we use replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations with an optimized all-atom protein force field (Amber ff03w) and an accurate water model (TIP4P/2005) to study the kinetics of helix formation in this peptide. We calculate temperature-dependent microscopic rate coefficients from the simulations by treating the dynamics between helical states as a Markov process using a recently developed formalism. The fluorescence relaxation curves obtained from simulated temperature jumps are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined results. We find that the kinetics are multiphasic but can be approximated well by a double-exponential function. The major processes contributing to the relaxation are the shrinking of helical states at the C-terminal end and a faster re-equilibration among coil states. Despite the fast observed relaxation, the helix nucleation time is estimated from our model to be 20-70 ns at 300 K, with a dependence on temperature well described by Arrhenius kinetics.",

abstract="Advances in spectroscopy, protein engineering, and peptide synthesis have had a dramatic impact on the understanding of the structures and stabilities of transient folding intermediates. The data available from a variety of proteins point to the existence of three common stages of folding. 1. Initially, the unfolded protein collapses to a presumably more compact form containing substantial nonpolar surfaces and secondary structure. This species has little thermodynamic stability and encompasses an ensemble of conformations that are in dynamic equilibrium and may contain non-native elements of structure. This reaction occurs in less than 5 ms and, from a thermodynamic perspective, may be a noncooperative transition. The relatively high content of secondary structure implies that this manifold of states must be far smaller than the manifold for the unfolded protein. 2. The next phase involves the further development of secondary and the beginnings of specific tertiary structure throughout the protein as well as of measurable stability. Nativelike elements of structure appear, possibly in the form of subdomains that are yet to be properly docked. In many instances, the packing is not as tight as is ultimately found in the native conformation, suggesting that the side chains are in general more mobile. Some elements of surface structure, such as loops and the peripheries of sheets and helices, are not yet well defined. This stage, which may consist of more than a single kinetic step, occurs in the 5-1000 ms time range. The ensemble of conformations is much reduced from the first stage; however, it is far from a single, highly populated form. 3. The final stage in folding corresponds to the concerted formation of many noncovalent interactions throughout the protein. The solidlike interior packing is achieved; the final secondary structure forms and the surface structures settle into place. The breadth of these conformational changes reflects the global cooperativity characteristic of protein folding reactions. A pictorial representation of the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects of this process is shown in Figure 1. This folding scheme emphasizes the progressive development of structure and stability through an ever-slowing set of reactions. Because the product of each stage of folding, with the exception of the final step, is an ensemble of related but not identical species, it is an oversimplification to describe the process as a pathway. Perhaps it is better described as a series of transitions between manifolds of structures that are in dynamic equilibrium within any given set.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Here, we quantitatively assess the binding affinity of DNA-binding proteins by molecular dynamics-based alchemical free energy simulations. A computational framework was developed to automatically set up in silico screening assays and estimate free energy differences using two independent procedures, based on equilibrium and non-equlibrium transformation pathways. The influence of simulation times on the accuracy of both procedures is presented. The binding specificity of a zinc-finger transcription factor to several sequences is calculated, and agreement with experimental data is shown.

abstract="There is currently a gap in knowledge between complexes of known three-dimensional structure and those known from other experimental methods such as affinity purifications or the two-hybrid system. This gap can sometimes be bridged by methods that extrapolate interaction information from one complex structure to homologues of the interacting proteins. To do this, it is important to know if and when proteins of the same type (e.g. family, superfamily or fold) interact in the same way. Here, we study interactions of known structure to address this question. We found all instances within the structural classification of proteins database of the same domain pairs interacting in different complexes, and then compared them with a simple measure (interaction RMSD). When plotted against sequence similarity we find that close homologues (30-40\% or higher sequence identity) almost invariably interact the same way. Conversely, similarity only in fold (i.e. without additional evidence for a common ancestor) is only rarely associated with a similarity in interaction. The results suggest that there is a twilight zone of sequence similarity where it is not possible to say whether or not domains will interact similarly. We also discuss the rare instances of fold similarities interacting the same way, and those where obviously homologous proteins interact differently.",

abstract="Protein structure prediction based on comparative modeling is the most efficient way to produce structural models when it can be performed. ORION is a dedicated webserver based on a new strategy that performs this task. The identification by ORION of suitable templates is performed using an original profile-profile approach that combines sequence and structure evolution information. Structure evolution information is encoded into profiles using structural features, such as solvent accessibility and local conformation -with Protein Blocks-, which give an accurate description of the local protein structure. ORION has recently been improved, increasing by 5\% the quality of its results. The ORION web server accepts a single protein sequence as input and searches homologous protein structures within minutes. Various databases such as PDB, SCOP and HOMSTRAD can be mined to find an appropriate structural template. For the modeling step, a protein 3D structure can be directly obtained from the selected template by MODELLER and displayed with global and local quality model estimation measures. The sequence and the predicted structure of 4 examples from the CAMEO server and a recent CASP11 target from the 'Hard' category (T0818-D1) are shown as pertinent examples.

journal="Journal of chemical information and modeling",

day="17",
abstract="Recently, we developed a new approach to protein-structure prediction, which combines template-based modeling with the physics-based coarse-grained UNited RESidue (UNRES) force field. In this approach, restrained multiplexed replica exchange molecular dynamics (MREMD) simulations with UNRES, with the C($\alpha$)-distance and virtual-bond-dihedral-angle restraints derived from knowledge-based models are carried out. In this work, we report a test of this approach in the 11th Community Wide Experiment on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP11), in which we used the template-based models from early-stage predictions by the LEE group CASP11 server (group 038, called 'nns'), and further improvement of the method. The quality of the models obtained in CASP11 was better than that resulting from unrestrained UNRES simulations; however, the obtained models were generally worse than the final nns models. Calculations with the final nns models, performed after CASP11, resulted in substantial improvement, especially for multi-domain proteins. Based on these results, we modified the procedure by deriving restraints from models from multiple servers, in this study the 4 top-performing servers in CASP11 (nns, BAKER-ROSETTASERVER, Zhang-server, and QUARK), and implementing either all restraints or only the restraints on the fragments that appear similar in the majority of models (the consensus fragments), outlier models discarded. Tests with 29 CASP11 human-prediction targets with length less than 400 amino-acid residues demonstrated that the consensus-fragment approach gave better results, i.e., lower $\alpha$-carbon Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) from the experimental structures, higher Template Modeling score (TM-score), and Global Distance Test Total Score (GDT\_TS) values than the best of the parent server models. Apart from global improvement (repacking and improving the orientation of domains and other substructures), improvement was also reached for template-based modeling targets, indicating that the approach has refinement capacity. Therefore, the consensus-fragment analysis is able to remove lower-quality models and poor-quality parts of the models without knowing the experimental structure.",

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications.

abstract="Theoretical and experimental studies of protein folding have suggested that the topology of the native state may be the most important factor determining the folding pathway of a protein, independent of its specific amino acid sequence. To test this concept, many experimental studies have been carried out with the aim of comparing the folding pathways of proteins that possess similar tertiary structures, but divergent sequences. Many of these studies focus on quantitative comparisons of folding transition state structures, as determined by Phi(f) value analysis of folding kinetic data. In some of these studies, folding transition state structures are found to be highly conserved, whereas in others they are not. We conclude that folds displaying more conserved transition state structures may have the most restricted number of possible folding pathways and that folds displaying low transition state structural conservation possess many potential pathways for reaching the native state.",

abstract="We have extended the resolution of the crystal structure of human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) to 1.7 A. BPI has two domains with the same fold, but with little sequence similarity. To understand the similarity in structure of the two domains, we compare the corresponding residue positions in the two domains by the method of 3D-1D profiles. A 3D-1D profile is a string formed by assigning each position in the 3D structure to one of 18 environment classes. The environment classes are defined by the local secondary structure, the area of the residue which is buried from solvent, and the fraction of the area buried by polar atoms. A structural alignment between the two BPI domains was used to compare the 3D-1D environments of structurally equivalent positions. Greater than 31\% of the aligned positions have conserved 3D-1D environments, but only 13\% have conserved residue identities. Analysis of the 3D-1D environmentally conserved positions helps to identify pairs of residues likely to be important in conserving the fold, regardless of the residue similarity. We find examples of 3D-1D environmentally conserved positions with dissimilar residues which nevertheless play similar structural roles. To generalize our findings, we analyzed four other proteins with similar structures yet dissimilar sequences. Together, these examples show that aligned pairs of dissimilar residues often share similar structural roles, stabilizing dissimilar sequences in the same fold.",

At each position in a fold there are constraints on the identities of amino acids from both the three-dimensional structure and the function of the protein. To characterize and quantify the structural constraints, we have made a comparative analysis of families of homologous globular proteins. Residues are classified according to amino acid type, secondary structure, accessibility of the sidechain, and existence of hydrogen bonds from sidechain to other sidechains or peptide carbonyl or amide functions. There are distinct patterns of substitution especially where residues are both solvent inaccessible and hydrogen bonded through their sidechains. The patterns of residue substitution can be used to construct templates or to identify 'key' residues if one or more structures are known. Conversely, analysis of conversation and substitution across a large family of aligned sequences in terms of substitution profiles can allow prediction of tertiary environment or indicate a functional role. Similar analyses can be used to test the validity of putative structures if several homologous sequences are available.",

abstract="The relationship between folding cooperativity and downhill, or barrier-free, folding of proteins under highly stabilizing conditions remains an unresolved topic, especially for proteins such as $\lambda$-repressor that fold on the microsecond timescale. Under aqueous conditions where downhill folding is most likely to occur, we measure the stability of multiple H bonds, using hydrogen exchange (HX) in a $\lambda$YA variant that is suggested to be an incipient downhill folder having an extrapolated folding rate constant of 2 {\texttimes} 10(5) s(-1) and a stability of 7.4 kcal{\textperiodcentered}mol(-1) at 298 K. At least one H bond on each of the three largest helices ($\alpha$1, $\alpha$3, and $\alpha$4) breaks during a common unfolding event that reflects global denaturation. The use of HX enables us to both examine folding under highly stabilizing, native-like conditions and probe the pretransition state region for stable species without the need to initiate the folding reaction. The equivalence of the stability determined at zero and high denaturant indicates that any residual denatured state structure minimally affects the stability even under native conditions. Using our $\psi$ analysis method along with mutational ϕ analysis, we find that the three aforementioned helices are all present in the folding transition state. Hence, the free energy surface has a sufficiently high barrier separating the denatured and native states that folding appears cooperative even under extremely stable and fast folding conditions.",

abstract="Kinetic folding experiments by pulsed hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) are a well-established tool for water-soluble proteins. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first that applies this approach to an integral membrane protein. The native state of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) comprises seven transmembrane helices and a covalently bound retinal cofactor. BR exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) induces partial unfolding and retinal loss. We employ a custom-built three-stage mixing device for pulsed-HDX/MS investigations of BR refolding. The reaction is triggered by mixing SDS-denatured protein with bicelles. After a variable folding time (10\thinspacems to 24\thinspaceh), the protein is exposed to excess D(2) O buffer under rapid exchange conditions. The HDX pulse is terminated by acid quenching after 24\thinspacems. Subsequent off-line analysis is performed by size exclusion chromatography and electrospray MS. These measurements yield the number of protected backbone N-H sites as a function of folding time, reflecting the recovery of secondary structure. Our results indicate that much of the BR secondary structure is formed quite late during the reaction, on a time scale of 10\thinspaces and beyond. It is hoped that in the future it will be possible to extend the pulsed-HDX/MS approach employed here to membrane proteins other than BR.",

In this study, we present an alternate analysis of interresidue contact using local structures defined by the structural alphabet introduced by Camproux et al. This structural alphabet allows to describe a 3D structure as a sequence of prototype fragments called structural letters, of 27 different types. Each residue can then be assigned to a particular local structure, even in loop regions. The analysis of interresidue contacts within protein structures defined using Vorono{\"i} tessellations reveals that pairwise contact specificity is greater in terms of structural letters than amino acids. Using a simple heuristic based on specificity score comparison, we find that 74\% of the long-range contacts within protein structures are better described using structural letters than amino acid types. The investigation is extended to a set of protein-protein complexes, showing that the similar global rules apply as for intraprotein contacts, with 64\% of the interprotein contacts best described by local structures. We then present an evaluation of pairing functions integrating structural letters to decoy scoring and show that some complexes could benefit from the use of structural letter-based pairing functions.",

A classical approach to this problem involves assessing changes in protein stability resulting from added cosolvents. Under any given conditions, protein molecules in aqueous buffer are in equilibrium between unfolded and folded states, U(nfolded) N(ative). Addition of organic osmolytes, small uncharged compounds found throughout nature, shift this equilibrium. Urea, a denaturing osmolyte, shifts the equilibrium toward U; trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a protecting osmolyte, shifts the equilibrium toward N. Using the Tanford Transfer Model, the thermodynamic response to many such osmolytes has been dissected into groupwise free energy contributions. It is found that the energetics involving backbone hydrogen bonding controls these shifts in protein stability almost entirely, with osmolyte cosolvents simply dialing between solvent-backbone versus backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, as a function of solvent quality. This reciprocal relationship establishes the essential link between protein thermodynamics and the protein's hydrogen-bonded backbone structure.",

abstract="The field of structural biology, whose aim is to elucidate the molecular and atomic structures of biological macromolecules, has long been at the forefront of biomedical sciences in adopting and developing computational research methods. Operating at the intersection between biophysics, biochemistry, and molecular biology, structural biology's growth into a foundational framework on which many concepts and findings of molecular biology are interpreted1 has depended largely on parallel advancements in computational tools and techniques. Without these computing advances, modern structural biology would likely have remained an exclusive pursuit practiced by few, and not become the widely practiced, foundational field it is today. As other areas of biomedical research increasingly embrace research computing techniques, the successes, failures and lessons of structural biology computing can serve as a useful guide to progress in other biomedically related research fields.",

abstract="Elucidation of the detailed structural features and sequence requirements for alpha helices of various lengths could be very important in understanding secondary structure formation in proteins and, hence, in the protein folding mechanism. An algorithm to characterize the geometry of an alpha helix from its C(alpha) coordinates has been developed and used to analyze the structures of long alpha helices (number of residues > or = 25) found in globular proteins, the crystal structure coordinates of which are available from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. All long alpha helices can be unambiguously characterized as belonging to one of three classes: linear, curved, or kinked, with a majority being curved. Analysis of the sequences of these helices reveals that the long alpha helices have unique sequence characteristics that distinguish them from the short alpha helices in globular proteins. The distribution and statistical propensities of individual amino acids to occur in long alpha helices are different from those found in short alpha helices, with amino acids having longer side chains and/or having a greater number of functional groups occurring more frequently in these helices. The sequences of the long alpha helices can be correlated with their gross structural features, i.e., whether they are curved, linear, or kinked, and in case of the curved helices, with their curvature.",

abstract="Folds are the basic building blocks of protein structures. Understanding the emergence of novel protein folds is an important step towards understanding the rules governing the evolution of protein structure and function and for developing tools for protein structure modeling and design. We explored the frequency of occurrences of an exhaustively classified library of supersecondary structural elements (Smotifs), in protein structures, in order to identify features that would define a fold as novel compared to previously known structures. We found that a surprisingly small set of Smotifs is sufficient to describe all known folds. Furthermore, novel folds do not require novel Smotifs, but rather are a new combination of existing ones. Novel folds can be typified by the inclusion of a relatively higher number of rarely occurring Smotifs in their structures and, to a lesser extent, by a novel topological combination of commonly occurring Smotifs. When investigating the structural features of Smotifs, we found that the top 10\% of most frequent ones have a higher fraction of internal contacts, while some of the most rare motifs are larger, and contain a longer loop region.",

Previous studies indicate that the propensities of individual amino acids to form particular secondary structures are the result of a combination of local conformational preferences and non-local factors. To examine the extent to which non-local factors influence the formation of secondary structural elements, the authors have designed an 11-amino-acid sequence (dubbed the 'chameleon' sequence) that folds as an $\alpha$-helix when in one position but as a $\beta$-sheet when in another position of the primary sequence of the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). Both proteins, chameleon-$\alpha$ and chameleon-$\beta$, are folded into structures similar to native GB1, as judged by several biophys. criteria. These results demonstrate that non-local interactions can det. the secondary structure of peptide sequences of substantial length. They also support views of protein folding that favor tertiary interactions as dominant determinants of structure. [on SciFinder(R)]",

abstract="Van der Waals (dispersion) forces contribute to interactions of proteins with other molecules or with surfaces, but because of the structural complexity of protein molecules, the magnitude of these effects is usually estimated based on idealized models of the molecular geometry, e.g., spheres or spheroids. The calculations reported here seek to account for both the geometric irregularity of protein molecules and the material properties of the interacting media. Whereas the latter are found to fall in the generally accepted range, the molecular shape is shown to cause the magnitudes of the interactions to differ significantly from those calculated using idealized models, with important consequences. First, the roughness of the molecular surface leads to much lower average interaction energies for both protein-protein and protein-surface cases relative to calculations in which the protein molecule is approximated as a sphere. These results indicate that a form of steric stabilization may be an important effect in protein solutions. Underlying this behavior is appreciable orientational dependence, one reflection of which is that molecules of complementary shape are found to exhibit very strong attractive dispersion interactions. Although this has been widely discussed previously in the context of molecular recognition processes, the broader implications of these phenomena may also be important at larger molecular separations, e.g., in the dynamics of aggregation, precipitation, and crystal growth.",

abstract="Finding structural similarities between proteins often helps reveal shared functionality, which otherwise might not be detected by native sequence information alone. Such similarity is usually detected and quantified by protein structure alignment. Determining the optimal alignment between two protein structures, however, remains a hard problem. An alternative approach is to approximate each three-dimensional protein structure using a sequence of motifs derived from a structural alphabet. Using this approach, structure comparison is performed by comparing the corresponding motif sequences or structural sequences. In this article, we measure the performance of such alphabets in the context of the protein structure classification problem. We consider both local and global structural sequences. Each letter of a local structural sequence corresponds to the best matching fragment to the corresponding local segment of the protein structure. The global structural sequence is designed to generate the best possible complete chain that matches the full protein structure. We use an alphabet of 20 letters, corresponding to a library of 20 motifs or protein fragments having four residues. We show that the global structural sequences approximate well the native structures of proteins, with an average coordinate root mean square of 0.69 A over 2225 test proteins. The approximation is best for all alpha-proteins, while relatively poorer for all beta-proteins. We then test the performance of four different sequence representations of proteins (their native sequence, the sequence of their secondary-structure elements, and the local and global structural sequences based on our fragment library) with different classifiers in their ability to classify proteins that belong to five distinct folds of CATH. Without surprise, the primary sequence alone performs poorly as a structure classifier. We show that addition of either secondary-structure information or local information from the structural sequence considerably improves the classification accuracy. The two fragment-based sequences perform better than the secondary-structure sequence but not well enough at this stage to be a viable alternative to more computationally intensive methods based on protein structure alignment.",

It was found that the N terminus of alpha-helices is characterized by recurring sch:mch and sch:sch bonds with elements of the preceding coil segment, while at the C terminus a frequent intra-helix sch:mch hydrogen bond was frequently observed. The residues at or near the beta-strand termini often cross-linked, through hydrogen-bonding, non-sequential coil segments.

abstract="The stability of beta-turns is calculated as a function of sequence and turn type with a Monte Carlo sampling technique. The conformational energy of four internal hydrogen-bonded turn types, I, I', II and II', is obtained by evaluating their gas phase energy with the CHARMM force field and accounting for solvation effects with the Finite Difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) method. All four turn types are found to be less stable than the coil state, independent of the sequence in the turn. The free-energy penalties associated with turn formation vary between 1.6 kcal/mol and 7.7 kcal/mol, depending on the sequence and turn type. Differences in turn stability arise mainly from intraresidue interactions within the two central residues of the turn. For each combination of the two central residues, except for -Gly-Gly-, the most stable beta-turn type is always found to occur most commonly in native proteins. The fact that a model based on local interactions accounts for the observed preference of specific sequences suggests that long-range tertiary interactions tend to play a secondary role in determining turn conformation. In contrast, for beta-hairpins, long-range interactions appear to dominate. Specifically, due to the right-handed twist of beta-strands, type I' turns for -Gly-Gly- are found to occur with high frequency, even when local energetics would dictate otherwise. The fact that any combination of two residues is found able to adopt a relatively low-energy turn structure explains why the amino acid sequence in turns is highly variable. The calculated free-energy cost of turn formation, when combined with related numbers obtained for alpha-helices and beta-sheets, suggests a model for the initiation of protein folding based on metastable fragments of secondary structure.",

The gain in prediction accuracy compared with the existing techniques, which are at best 72\%, is achieved by secondary structure propensities based on both local and long-range effects, utilization of similar sequence information in the form of carefully selected pairwise alignment fragments, and reliance on a large collection of known protein primary structures.

abstract="Using a test set of 13 small, compact proteins, we demonstrate that a remarkably simple protocol can capture native topology from secondary structure information alone, in the absence of long-range interactions. It has been a long-standing open question whether such information is sufficient to determine a protein's fold. Indeed, even the far simpler problem of reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its exact backbone torsion angles has remained a difficult challenge owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, cause large errors in structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm; the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Here, correct secondary structure assignments (alpha-helix, beta-strand, beta-turn, polyproline II, coil) were used to constrain polypeptide backbone chains devoid of side chains, and the most stable folded conformations were determined, using Monte Carlo simulation. Just three terms were used to assess stability: molecular compaction, steric exclusion, and hydrogen bonding. For nine of the 13 proteins, this protocol restricts the main chain to a surprisingly small number of energetically favorable topologies, with the native one prominent among them.",

abstract="In recent host-guest studies, the helix-forming tendencies of amino acid residues have been quantified by three groups, each obtaining similar results [Padmanabhan, S., Marqusee, S., Ridgeway, T., Laue, T. M. \& Baldwin, R. L. (1990) Nature (London) 344, 268-270; O'Neil, K. T. \& DeGrado, W. F. (1990) Science 250, 646-651; Lyu, P. C., Liff, M. I., Marky, L. A. \& Kallenbach, N. R. (1990) Science 250, 669-673]. Here, we explore the hypothesis that these measured helix-forming propensities are due primarily to conformational restrictions imposed upon residue side chains by the helix itself. This proposition is tested by calculating the extent to which the bulky helix backbone ``freezes out'' available degrees of freedom in helix side chains. Specifically, for a series of apolar residues, the difference in configurational entropy, delta S, between each side chain in the unfolded state and in the alpha-helical state is obtained from a simple Monte Carlo calculation. These computed entropy differences are then compared with the experimentally determined values. Measured and calculated values are found to be in close agreement for naturally occurring amino acids and in total disagreement for non-natural amino acids. In the calculation, delta S(Ala) = 0. The rank order of entropy loss for the series of natural apolar side chains under consideration is Ala less than Leu less than Trp less than Met less than Phe less than Ile less than Tyr less than Val. Among these, none favor helix formation; Ala is neutral, and all remaining residues are unfavorable to varying degrees. Thus, applied to side chains, the term ``helix preference'' is a misnomer. While side chain-side chain interactions may modulate stability in some instances, our results indicate that the drive to form helices must originate in the backbone, consistent with Pauling's view of four decades ago [Pauling, L., Corey, R. B. \& Branson, H. R. (1951) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 37, 205-210].",

abstract="The importance of thorough analyses of the secondary structures in proteins as basic structural units cannot be overemphasized. Although recent computational methods have achieved reasonably high accuracy for predicting secondary structures from amino acid sequences, a simple and fundamental empirical approach to characterize the amino acid composition of secondary structures was performed mainly in 1970s, with a small number of analyzed structures. To extend this classical approach using a large number of analyzed structures, here we characterized the amino acid sequences of secondary structures (12 154 alpha-helix units, 4592 3(10)-helix units, 16 787 beta-strand units, and 30 811 ``other'' units), using the representative three-dimensional protein structure records (1641 protein chains) from the Protein Data Bank. We first examined the length and the amino acid compositions of secondary structures, including rank order differences and assignment relationships among amino acids. These compositional results were largely, but not entirely, consistent with the previous studies. In addition, we examined the frequency of 400 amino acid doublets and 8000 triplets in secondary structures based on their relative counts, termed the availability. We identified not only some triplets that were specific to a certain secondary structure but also so-called zero-count triplets, which did not occur in a given secondary structure at all, even though they were probabilistically predicted to occur several times. Taken together, the present study revealed essential features of secondary structures and suggests potential applications in the secondary structure prediction and the functional design of protein sequences.",

abstract="As the simplest and most prevalent motif of protein folding, $\alpha$-helix initiation is the starting point of macromolecular complexity. In this work, helix initiation was directly measured via ultrafast temperature-jump spectroscopy on the smallest possible helix nucleus for which only the first turn is formed. The rate's dependence on sequence, length, and temperature reveals the fastest possible events in protein folding dynamics, and it was possible to separate the rate-limiting torsional (conformational) diffusion from the fast annealing of the helix. An analytic coarse-grained model for this process, which predicts the initiation rate as a function of temperature, confirms this picture. Moreover, the stipulations of the model were verified by ensemble-converging all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, which reproduced both the picosecond annealing and the nanosecond diffusion processes observed experimentally.",

abstract="How does a folding protein negotiate a vast, featureless conformational landscape and adopt its native structure in biological real time? Motivated by this search problem, we developed a novel algorithm to compare protein structures. Procedures to identify structural analogs are typically conducted in three-dimensional space: the tertiary structure of a target protein is matched against each candidate in a database of structures, and goodness of fit is evaluated by a distance-based measure, such as the root-mean-square distance between target and candidate. This is an expensive approach because three-dimensional space is complex. Here, we transform the problem into a simpler one-dimensional procedure. Specifically, we identify and label the 11 most populated residue basins in a database of high-resolution protein structures. Using this 11-letter alphabet, any protein's three-dimensional structure can be transformed into a one-dimensional string by mapping each residue onto its corresponding basin. Similarity between the resultant basin strings can then be evaluated by conventional sequence-based comparison. The disorder {\textrightarrow} order folding transition is abridged on both sides. At the onset, folding conditions necessitate formation of hydrogen-bonded scaffold elements on which proteins are assembled, severely restricting the magnitude of accessible conformational space. Near the end, chain topology is established prior to emergence of the close-packed native state. At this latter stage of folding, the chain remains molten, and residues populate natural basins that are approximated by the 11 basins derived here. In essence, our algorithm reduces the protein-folding search problem to mapping the amino acid sequence onto a restricted basin string.",

Accordingly, the energy landscape of a blocked peptide unit can be mapped in two dimensions, as shown by Ramachandran, Sasisekharan, and Ramakrishnan almost half a century ago. With atoms approximated as hard spheres, the eponymous Ramachandran plot demonstrated that steric clashes alone eliminate 3/4 of ϕ,$\psi$-space, a result that has guided all subsequent work. Here, we show that adding hydrogen-bonding constraints to these steric criteria eliminates another substantial region of ϕ,$\psi$-space for a blocked peptide; for conformers within this region, an amide hydrogen is solvent-inaccessible, depriving it of a hydrogen-bonding partner. Yet, this ``forbidden'' region is well populated in folded proteins, which can provide longer-range intramolecular hydrogen-bond partners for these otherwise unsatisfied polar groups. Consequently, conformational space expands under folding conditions, a paradigm-shifting realization that prompts an experimentally verifiable conjecture about likely folding pathways.",

In general, intrinsically disordered proteins interact with a target ligand (often DNA) and undergo a structural transition to a folded form when bound. Several features of intrinsically disordered proteins make them well suited to interacting with multiple targets and to cell regulation.

abstract="The Gaussian-distributed random coil has been the dominant model for denatured proteins since the 1950s, and it has long been interpreted to mean that proteins are featureless, statistical coils in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Here, we demonstrate that random-coil statistics are not a unique signature of featureless polymers. The random-coil model does predict the experimentally determined coil dimensions of denatured proteins successfully. Yet, other equally convincing experiments have shown that denatured proteins are biased toward specific conformations, in apparent conflict with the random-coil model. We seek to resolve this paradox by introducing a contrived counterexample in which largely native protein ensembles nevertheless exhibit random-coil characteristics. Specifically, proteins of known structure were used to generate disordered conformers by varying backbone torsion angles at random for approximately 8\% of the residues; the remaining approximately 92\% of the residues remained fixed in their native conformation. Ensembles of these disordered structures were generated for 33 proteins by using a torsion-angle Monte Carlo algorithm with hard-sphere sterics; bulk statistics were then calculated for each ensemble. Despite this extreme degree of imposed internal structure, these ensembles have end-to-end distances and mean radii of gyration that agree well with random-coil expectations in all but two cases.",

abstract="Although intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are widespread in nature and play diverse and important roles in biology, they have to date been little characterized structurally. Auspiciously, intensified efforts using NMR spectroscopy have started to uncover the breadth of their conformational landscape. In particular, polypeptide backbone chemical shifts are emerging as powerful descriptors of local dynamic deviations from the ``random coil'' state toward canonical types of secondary structure. These digressions, in turn, can be connected to functional or dysfunctional protein states, for example, in adaptive molecular recognition and protein aggregation. Here we describe a first inventory of IDP backbone (15)N, (1)H(N), (1)H($\alpha$), (13)C(O), (13)C($\beta$), and (13)C($\alpha$) chemical shifts using data obtained for a set of 14 proteins of unrelated sequence and function. Singular value decomposition was used to parametrize this database of 6903 measured shifts collectively in terms of 20 amino acid-specific random coil chemical shifts and 40 sequence-dependent left- and right-neighbor correction factors, affording the ncIDP library. For natively unfolded proteins, random coil backbone chemical shifts computed from the primary sequence displayed root-mean-square deviations of 0.65, 0.14, 0.12, 0.50, 0.36, and 0.41 ppm from the experimentally measured values for the (15)N, (1)H(N), (1)H($\alpha$), (13)C(O), (13)C($\beta$), and (13)C($\alpha$) chemical shifts, respectively. The ncIDP prediction accuracy is significantly higher than that obtained with libraries for small peptides or ``coil'' regions of folded proteins.",

Temperature-sensitive mutants are valuable tools for geneticists, particularly in the study of essential genes. However, finding ts mutations typically relies on generating and screening many thousands of mutations, which is an expensive and labor-intensive process. Here we describe an in silico method that uses Rosetta and machine learning techniques to predict a highly accurate ``top 5'' list of ts mutations given the structure of a protein of interest. Rosetta is a protein structure prediction and design code, used here to model and score how proteins accommodate point mutations with side-chain and backbone movements. We show that integrating Rosetta relax-derived features with sequence-based features results in accurate temperature-sensitive mutation predictions.",

abstract="In the accompanying papers we have shown that sequence errors of public databases and confusion of paralogs and epaktologs (proteins that are related only through the independent acquisition of the same domain types) significantly distort the picture that emerges from comparison of the domain architecture (DA) of multidomain Metazoan proteins since they introduce a strong bias in favor of terminal over internal DA change. The issue of whether terminal or internal DA changes occur with greater probability has very important implications for the DA evolution of multidomain proteins since gene fusion can add domains only at terminal positions, whereas domain-shuffling is capable of inserting domains both at internal and terminal positions. As a corollary, overestimation of terminal DA changes may be misinterpreted as evidence for a dominant role of gene fusion in DA evolution. In this manuscript we show that in several recent studies of DA evolution of Metazoa the authors used databases that are significantly contaminated with incomplete, abnormal and mispredicted sequences (e.g., UniProtKB/TrEMBL, EnsEMBL) and/or the authors failed to separate paralogs and epaktologs, explaining why these studies concluded that the major mechanism for gains of new domains in metazoan proteins is gene fusion. In contrast with the latter conclusion, our studies on high quality orthologous and paralogous Swiss-Prot sequences confirm that shuffling of mobile domains had a major role in the evolution of multidomain proteins of Metazoa and especially those formed in early vertebrates.",

At the primary structure level, methods are considered for detection of remotely related sequences and for recognizing amino acid patterns to predict posttranslational modifications and binding sites. The techniques involving secondary structural features include prediction of secondary structure, membrane-spanning regions, and secondary structural class. At the tertiary structural level, methods for threading a sequence into a mainchain fold, homology modeling and assigning sequences to protein families with similar folds are discussed. A literature analysis suggests that, to date, threading techniques are not able to show their superiority over sequence pattern recognition methods. Recent progress in the state of ab initio structure calculation is reviewed in detail. The analysis shows that many structural features can be predicted from the amino acid sequence much better than just a few years ago and with attendant utility in experimental research. Best prediction can be achieved for new protein sequences that can be assigned to well-studied protein families. For single sequences without homologues, the folding problem has not yet been solved.",

abstract="Understanding molecular kinetics, and particularly protein folding, is a classic grand challenge in molecular biophysics. Network models, such as Markov state models (MSMs), are one potential solution to this problem. MSMs have recently yielded quantitative agreement with experimentally derived structures and folding rates for specific systems, leaving them positioned to potentially provide a deeper understanding of molecular kinetics that can lead to experimentally testable hypotheses. Here we use existing MSMs for the villin headpiece and NTL9, which were constructed from atomistic simulations, to accomplish this goal. In addition, we provide simpler, humanly comprehensible networks that capture the essence of molecular kinetics and reproduce qualitative phenomena like the apparent two-state folding often seen in experiments. Together, these models show that protein dynamics are dominated by stochastic jumps between numerous metastable states and that proteins have heterogeneous unfolded states (many unfolded basins that interconvert more rapidly with the native state than with one another) yet often still appear two-state. Most importantly, we find that protein native states are hubs that can be reached quickly from any other state. However, metastability and a web of nonnative states slow the average folding rate. Experimental tests for these findings and their implications for other fields, like protein design, are also discussed.",

For selected fragments, up to 14 residues long, the lowest free energy structures produced by the GA are similar in conformation to the corresponding experimental structures in most cases. There are three main conclusions from these results. First, the genetic algorithm is an effective method for searching amongst the compact conformations of a polypeptide chain. Second, the free energy function is generally able to select native-like conformations. However, some deficiencies are identified, and further development is proposed. Third, the selection of native-like conformations for some protein fragments establishes that in these cases the conformation observed in the full protein structure is largely context independent.

abstract="To visualize a bird's-eye view of an ensemble of proteomes for various species, we recently developed a novel method of mapping a proteome ensemble into Three-Dimensional (3D) vector space. In this study, the ``proteome'' is defined as the entire set of all proteins encoded in a genome sequence, and these proteins were dealt with at the level of the SCOP Fold. First, we represented the proteome of a species s by a 1053-dimensional vector x(s), where its length ∣x(s)∣ represents the overall amount of all the SCOP Folds in the proteome, and its unit vector x(s)/∣x(s)∣ represents the relative composition of the SCOP Folds in the proteome and the size of the dimension, 1053, is the number of all possible Folds in the proteome ensemble given. Second, we mapped the vector x(s) to the 3D vector y(s), based on the two simple principles: (1) ∣y(s)∣=∣x(s)∣, and (2) the angle between y(s) and y(t) maximally correlates with the angle between x(s) and x(t). We applied to the mapping of a proteome ensemble for 456 species, which were retrieved from the Genomes TO Protein structures and functions (GTOP) database. As a result, we succeeded in the mapping in that the properties of the 1053-dimensional vectors were quantitatively conserved in the 3D vectors. Particularly, the angles between vectors before and after the mapping highly correlated with each other (correlation coefficients were 0.95-0.96). This new mapping method will allow researchers to intuitively interpret the visual information presented in the maps in a highly effective manner.",

In order to fully exploit the opportunities offered by such a 'tube model' approach, we present here a strategy to combine it with molecular dynamics simulations. This strategy is based on the incorporation of the 'CamTube' force field into the Gromacs molecular dynamics package. By considering the case of a 60-residue polyvaline chain, we show that CamTube molecular dynamics simulations can comprehensively explore the conformational space of proteins. We obtain this result by a 20 $\mu$s metadynamics simulation of the polyvaline chain that recapitulates the currently known protein fold universe. We further show that, if residue-specific interaction potentials are added to the CamTube force field, it is possible to fold a protein into a topology close to that of its native state. These results illustrate how the CamTube force field can be used to explore efficiently the universe of protein folds with good accuracy and very limited computational cost.",

abstract="The folding and unfolding kinetics of the B-domain of staphylococcal protein A, a small three-helix bundle protein, were probed by NMR. The lineshape of a single histidine resonance was fit as a function of denaturant to give folding and unfolding rate constants. The B-domain folds extremely rapidly in a two-state manner, with a folding rate constant of 120,000 s-1, making it one of the fastest-folding proteins known. Diffusion-collision theory predicts folding and unfolding rate constants that are in good agreement with the experimental values. The apparent rate constant as a function of denaturant ('chevron plot') is predicted within an order of magnitude. Our results are consistent with a model whereby fast-folding proteins utilize a diffusion-collision mechanism, with the preorganization of one or more elements of secondary structure in the unfolded protein.",

abstract="Globular proteins fold to create compact structures rich in alpha-helices and beta-sheets. While studies of cubic lattice models of simplified polypeptide chains have concluded that secondary structure is a necessary consequence of chain compactness, different conclusions have been reached from studies of off-lattice models of simplified chains. In an attempt to resolve this controversy, we study an all-atom off-lattice model of a protein subject to a variety of simplified energy functions. A Monte Carlo simulated annealing algorithm is used to search conformational space quickly. The algorithm uses pivot-type moves in which a residue is selected at random and the values of its main-chain dihedral angles are changed. The energy function used to accept or reject moves is taken to be either a term proportional to the volume occupied by a structure (to mimic the hydrophobic effect), a term proportional to the energy of main-chain hydrogen bonding, or a combination of these two terms. Secondary structure content is evaluated using several different definitions. For all the definitions used, compactness alone produces a 10\% increase in secondary structure content. However, this is a small fraction of the secondary structure observed in native protein structures. Structures produced by minimizing the hydrogen bond energy have extensive secondary structure but are not densely packed. Structures having both the high density of native structures and extensive secondary structure are produced by minimizing combinations of the volume and hydrogen bond energy terms. Our results emphasize the close relationship between secondary structure and the geometry of main-chain hydrogen bonding. The results are consistent with a description of protein folding in which the hydrophobic effect favors dense packing while hydrogen bonding determines the specific local geometry which generates secondary structure. To make an analogy with lattice studies of packing density and secondary structure, it seems that hydrophobicity provides the packing density while hydrogen bonding provides the lattice.",

abstract="Computational methods are rapidly gaining importance in the field of structural biology, mostly due to the explosive progress in genome sequencing projects and the large disparity between the number of sequences and the number of structures. There has been an exponential growth in the number of available protein sequences and a slower growth in the number of structures. There is therefore an urgent need to develop computational methods to predict structures and identify their functions from the sequence. Developing methods that will satisfy these needs both efficiently and accurately is of paramount importance for advances in many biomedical fields, including drug development and discovery of biomarkers. A novel method called fast learning optimized prediction methodology (FLOPRED) is proposed for predicting protein secondary structure, using knowledge-based potentials combined with structure information from the CATH database. A neural network-based extreme learning machine (ELM) and advanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used with this data that yield better and faster convergence to produce more accurate results. Protein secondary structures are predicted reliably, more efficiently and more accurately using FLOPRED. These techniques yield superior classification of secondary structure elements, with a training accuracy ranging between 83 \% and 87 \% over a widerange of hidden neurons and a cross-validated testing accuracy ranging between 81 \% and 84 \% and a segment overlap (SOV) score of 78 \% that are obtained with different sets of proteins. These results are comparable to other recently published studies, but are obtained with greater efficiencies, in terms of time and cost.",

We call the methods in this class projection methods as they rely on a mapping of protein structure into a high-dimensional vector space. Once the mapping is done, the structure comparison is reduced to distance computation between corresponding vectors. As structural similarity is approximated by distance between projections, the success of any projection method depends on how well its mapping function is able to capture the salient features of protein structure. There is no agreement on what constitutes a good projection technique and the three currently known projection methods utilize very different approaches to the mapping construction, both in terms of what structural elements are included and how this information is integrated to produce a vector representation.",

The library was generated using an automated method for finding correlations between protein sequence and local structure, and contains most previously described local sequence-structure correlations as well as new relationships, including a diverging type-II beta-turn, a frayed helix, and a proline-terminated helix. The query sequence is scanned for segments 7 to 19 residues in length that strongly match one of the 82 patterns in the library. Matching segments are assigned the three-dimensional structure characteristic of the corresponding sequence pattern, and backbone torsion angles for the entire query sequence are then predicted by piecing together mutually compatible segment predictions. In predictions of local structure in a test set of 55 proteins, about 50\% of all residues, and 76\% of residues covered by high-confidence predictions, were found in eight-residue segments within 1.4 A of their true structures. The predictions are complementary to traditional secondary structure predictions because they are considerably more specific in turn regions, and may contribute to ab initio tertiary structure prediction and fold recognition.",

abstract="We have trained a two-layered feed-forward neural network on a non-redundant data base of 130 protein chains to predict the secondary structure of water-soluble proteins. A new key aspect is the use of evolutionary information in the form of multiple sequence alignments that are used as input in place of single sequences. The inclusion of protein family information in this form increases the prediction accuracy by six to eight percentage points. A combination of three levels of networks results in an overall three-state accuracy of 70.8\% for globular proteins (sustained performance). If four membrane protein chains are included in the evaluation, the overall accuracy drops to 70.2\%. The prediction is well balanced between alpha-helix, beta-strand and loop: 65\% of the observed strand residues are predicted correctly. The accuracy in predicting the content of three secondary structure types is comparable to that of circular dichroism spectroscopy. The performance accuracy is verified by a sevenfold cross-validation test, and an additional test on 26 recently solved proteins. Of particular practical importance is the definition of a position-specific reliability index. For half of the residues predicted with a high level of reliability the overall accuracy increases to better than 82\%. A further strength of the method is the more realistic prediction of segment length. The protein family prediction method is available for testing by academic researchers via an electronic mail server.",

Predictions for protein domains with fewer than 125 amino acids regularly have a backbone root-mean-square deviation of better than 5.0 A. More impressively, there are several cases in which Rosetta has been used to predict structures with atomic level accuracy better than 2.5 A. In addition to de novo structure prediction, Rosetta also has methods for molecular docking, homology modeling, determining protein structures from sparse experimental NMR or EPR data, and protein design. Rosetta has been used to accurately design a novel protein structure, predict the structure of protein-protein complexes, design altered specificity protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and stabilize proteins and protein complexes.

abstract="The poly-l-proline type II (PPII) helix in recent years has emerged clearly as a structural class not only of fibrillar proteins (in collagen, PPII is a dominant conformation) but also of the folded and unfolded proteins. Although much less abundant in folded proteins than the $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-structure, the left-handed, extended PPII helix represents the only frequently occurring regular structure apart from these two structure classes. Natively unfolded proteins have a high content of the PPII helices identified by spectroscopic methods. Apart from the structural function, PPII is favorable for protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions and plays a major role in signal transduction and protein complex assembly, as this structure is often found in binding sites, specifically binding sites of widely spread SH3 domains. PPII helices do not necessarily contain proline, but proline has high PPII propensity. Commonly occurring proline-rich regions, serving as recognition sites, are likely to have PPII structure. PPII helices are involved in transcription, cell motility, self-assembly, elasticity, and bacterial and viral pathogenesis, and has an important structural role in amyloidogenic proteins. However, PPII helices are not always assigned in experimentally solved structures, and they are rarely used in protein structure modeling. We aim to give an overview of this structural class and of the place it holds in our current understanding of protein structure and function. This review is subdivided into three main parts: the first part covers PPII helices in unfolded peptides and proteins, the second part includes studies of the PPII helices in folded proteins, and the third part discusses the functional role of the PPII.",

abstract="Predicting the set of sequences that are tolerated by a protein or protein interface, while maintaining a desired function, is useful for characterizing protein interaction specificity and for computationally designing sequence libraries to engineer proteins with new functions. Here we provide a general method, a detailed set of protocols, and several benchmarks and analyses for estimating tolerated sequences using flexible backbone protein design implemented in the Rosetta molecular modeling software suite. The input to the method is at least one experimentally determined three-dimensional protein structure or high-quality model. The starting structure(s) are expanded or refined into a conformational ensemble using Monte Carlo simulations consisting of backrub backbone and side chain moves in Rosetta. The method then uses a combination of simulated annealing and genetic algorithm optimization methods to enrich for low-energy sequences for the individual members of the ensemble. To emphasize certain functional requirements (e.g. forming a binding interface), interactions between and within parts of the structure (e.g. domains) can be reweighted in the scoring function. Results from each backbone structure are merged together to create a single estimate for the tolerated sequence space. We provide an extensive description of the protocol and its parameters, all source code, example analysis scripts and three tests applying this method to finding sequences predicted to stabilize proteins or protein interfaces. The generality of this method makes many other applications possible, for example stabilizing interactions with small molecules, DNA, or RNA. Through the use of within-domain reweighting and/or multistate design, it may also be possible to use this method to find sequences that stabilize particular protein conformations or binding interactions over others.",

Their substitution for predicted secondary structure as restraints for ab initio structure prediction doubles the success rate. This result demonstrates the potential of predicted local structure for fragment-free tertiary-structure prediction.

The binding affinity, defined as the strength of these interactions, is translated into physico-chemical terms in the dissociation constant (K(d)), the latter being an experimental measure that determines whether an interaction will be formed in solution or not. Predicting binding affinity from structural models has been a matter of active research for more than 40 years because of its fundamental role in drug development. However, all available approaches are incapable of predicting the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes from coordinates alone. Here, we examine both theoretical and experimental limitations that complicate the derivation of structure-affinity relationships. Most work so far has concentrated on binary interactions. Systems of increased complexity are far from being understood. The main physico-chemical measure that relates to binding affinity is the buried surface area, but it does not hold for flexible complexes. For the latter, there must be a significant entropic contribution that will have to be approximated in the future. We foresee that any theoretical modelling of these interactions will have to follow an integrative approach considering the biology, chemistry and physics that underlie protein-protein recognition.",

Proteins are built from alpha-helices and/or beta-strands interconnected by these coil segments. Here, we investigate the conformational determinants of short coil segments, with particular emphasis on chain turns. Toward this goal, we extracted a comprehensive set of two-, three-, and four-residue turns from X-ray-elucidated proteins and classified them by conformation. A remarkably small number of unique conformers account for most of this experimentally determined set, whereas remaining members span a large number of rare conformers, many occurring only once in the entire protein database. Factors determining conformation were identified via Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations devised to test the effectiveness of various energy terms. Simulated structures were validated by comparison to experimental counterparts. After filtering rare conformers, we found that 98\% of the remaining experimentally determined turn population could be reproduced by applying a hydrogen bond energy term to an exhaustively generated ensemble of clash-free conformers in which no backbone polar group lacks a hydrogen-bond partner. Further, at least 90\% of longer coil segments, ranging from 5- to 20 residues, were found to be structural composites of these shorter primitives. These results are pertinent to protein structure prediction, where approaches can be divided into either empirical or ab initio methods. Empirical methods use database-derived information; ab initio methods rely on physical-chemical principles exclusively. Replacing the database-derived coil library with one generated from first principles would transform any empirically based method into its corresponding ab initio homologue.",

There is a neighboring residue effect on backbone conformation, discovered in 1997 from measurements of (3)J(HN alpha) coupling constants. The neighboring residue effect appears also in the ``coil library'' of Protein Data Bank structures of residues not in alpha-helix and not in beta-structure. When a neighboring residue (i - 1 or i + 1) belongs to class L (aromatic and beta-branched amino acids, FHITVWY) rather than class S (all others, G and P excluded), then the backbone angle of residue i is more negative for essentially all amino acids. Calculated values of peptide solvation (electrostatic solvation free energy, ESF) predict basic properties of the neighboring residue effect. We show that L amino acids reduce the solvation of neighboring peptide groups more than S amino acids. When tripeptides from the coil library are excised to allow solvation, the central residues have more negative values of but less negative values of with L than with S neighbors. The coil library values of , which vary strikingly among the amino acids, are correlated with the neighboring residue effect seen by ESF. Moreover, values for the ``blocking effect'' of side chains on the hydrogen exchange rates of peptide NH protons are correlated with ESF values.",

The algorithm is tested on 500 nonhomologous proteins independent of the training sets.

abstract="Since the demonstration that the sequence of a protein encodes its structure, the prediction of structure from sequence remains an outstanding problem that impacts numerous scientific disciplines, including many genome projects. By iteratively fixing secondary structure assignments of residues during Monte Carlo simulations of folding, our coarse-grained model without information concerning homology or explicit side chains can outperform current homology-based secondary structure prediction methods for many proteins. The computationally rapid algorithm using only single (phi,psi) dihedral angle moves also generates tertiary structures of accuracy comparable with existing all-atom methods for many small proteins, particularly those with low homology. Hence, given appropriate search strategies and scoring functions, reduced representations can be used for accurately predicting secondary structure and providing 3D structures, thereby increasing the size of proteins approachable by homology-free methods and the accuracy of template methods that depend on a high-quality input secondary structure.",

abstract="The exquisite side chain close-packing in the protein core and at binding interfaces has prompted a conviction that packing selectivity is the primary mechanism for molecular recognition in folding and/or binding reactions. Contrary to this view, molten globule proteins can adopt native topology and bind targets tightly and specifically in the absence of side chain close-packing. The molten globule is a highly dynamic form with native-like secondary structure and a loose protein core that admits solvent. The related (but still controversial) dry molten globule is an expanded form of the native protein with largely intact topology but a tighter protein core that excludes solvent. Neither form retains side chain close-packing, and therefore both structure and function must result from other factors, assuming that the reality of the dry molten globule is accepted. This simplifying realization calls for a re-evaluation of established models.",

abstract="Many single-domain proteins exhibit two-state folding kinetics, with folding rates that span more than six orders of magnitude. A quantity of much recent interest for such proteins is their contact order, the average separation in sequence between contacting residue pairs. Numerous studies have reached the surprising conclusion that contact order is well-correlated with the logarithm of the folding rate for these small, well-characterized molecules. Here, we investigate the physico-chemical basis for this finding by asking whether contact order is actually a composite number that measures the fraction of local secondary structure in the protein; viz. turns, helices, and hairpins. To pursue this question, we calculated the secondary structure content for 24 two-state proteins and obtained coefficients that predict their folding rates. The predicted rates correlate strongly with experimentally determined rates, comparable to the correlation with contact order. Further, these predicted folding rates are correlated strongly with contact order. Our results suggest that the folding rate of two-state proteins is a function of their local secondary structure content, consistent with the hierarchic model of protein folding. Accordingly, it should be possible to utilize secondary structure prediction methods to predict folding rates from sequence alone.",

A systematic study was made of 67 proteins of known structure revealing 270 omega loops. Although such loops are typically regarded as ``random coil,'' they are, in fact, highly compact substructures and may also be independent folding units. Loops are almost invariably situated at the protein surface where they are poised to assume important roles in molecular function and biological recognition. They are often observed to be modules of evolutionary exchange and are also natural candidates for bioengineering studies.",

abstract="The preferences of amino acid residues for ,psi backbone angles vary strikingly among the amino acids, as shown by the backbone angle found from the (3)J(H(alpha),H(N)) coupling constant for short peptides in water. New data for the (3)J(H(alpha),H(N)) values of blocked amino acids (dipeptides) are given here. Dipeptides exhibit the full range of coupling constants shown by longer peptides such as GGXGG and dipeptides present the simplest system for analyzing backbone preferences. The dipeptide coupling constants are surprisingly close to values computed from the coil library (conformations of residues not in helices and not in sheets). Published coupling constants for GGXGG peptides agree closely with dipeptide values for all nonpolar residues and for some polar residues but not for X = D, N, T, and Y, which are probably affected by polar side chain-backbone interactions in GGXGG peptides. Thus, intrinsic backbone preferences are already determined at the dipeptide level and remain almost unchanged in GGXGG peptides and are strikingly similar in the coil library of conformations from protein structures. The simplest explanation for the backbone preferences is that backbone conformations are strongly affected by electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions in the peptide backbone and by screening of these interactions with water, which depends on nearby side chains. Strong backbone electrostatic interactions occur in dipeptides. This is shown by calculations both of backbone electrostatic energy for different conformers of the alanine dipeptide in the gas phase and by electrostatic solvation free energies of amino acid dipeptides.",

abstract="The following three issues concerning the backbone dihedral angles of protein structures are presented. (1) How do the dihedral angles of the 20 amino acids depend on the identity and conformation of their nearest residues? (2) To what extent are the native dihedral angles determined by local (dihedral) potentials? (3) How to build a knowledge-based potential for a residue's dihedral angles, considering the identity and conformation of its nearest residues? We find that the dihedral angle distribution for a residue can significantly depend on the identity and conformation of its adjacent residues. These correlations are in sharp contrast to the Flory isolated-pair hypothesis. Statistical potentials are built for all combinations of residue triplets and depend on the dihedral angles between consecutive residues. First, a low-resolution potential is obtained, which only differentiates between the main populated basins in the dihedral angle density plots. Minimization of the dihedral potential for 125 test proteins reveals that most native alpha-helical residues (89\%) and a large fraction of native beta-sheet residues (47\%) adopt conformations close to their native one. For native loop residues, the percentage is 48\%. It is also found that this fraction is higher for residues away from the ends of alpha or beta secondary structure elements. In addition, a higher resolution potential is built as a function of dihedral angles by a smoothing procedure and continuous functions interpolations. Monte Carlo energy minimization with this potential results in a lower fraction for native beta-sheet residues. Nevertheless, because of the higher flexibility and entropy of beta structures, they could be preferred under the influence of non-local interactions. In general, most alpha-helices and many beta-sheets are strongly determined by the local potential, while the conformations in loops and near the end of beta-sheets are more influenced by non-local interactions.",

keywords="Computer Simulation; Models; Molecular; Protein Conformation; Proteins; Software",
abstract="A computer program is described that produces a description of the secondary structure and supersecondary structure of a polypeptide chain using the list of alpha carbon coordinates as input. Restricting the term ``secondary structure'' to the conformation of contiguous segments of the chain, the program determines the initial and final residues in helices, extended strands, sharp turns, and omega loops. This is accomplished through the use of difference distance matrices. The distances in idealized models of the segments are compared with the actual structure, and the differences are evaluated for agreement within preset limits. The program assigns 90-95\% of the residues in most proteins to at least one type of secondary element. In a second step the now-defined helices and strands are idealized as straight line segments, and the axial directions and locations are compiled from the input C alpha coordinate list. These data are used to check for moderate curvature in strands and helices, and the secondary structure list is corrected where necessary. The geometric relations between these line segments are then calculated and output as the first level of supersecondary structure. A maximum of six parameters are required for a complete description of the relations between each pair. Frequently a less complete description will suffice, for example just the interaxial separation and angle. Both the secondary structure and one aspect of the supersecondary structure can be displayed in a character matrix analogous to the distance matrix format. This allows a quite accurate two-dimensional display of the three-dimensional structure, and several examples are presented. A procedure for searching for arbitrary substructures in proteins using distance matrices is also described. A search for the DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif in the Protein Data Bank serves as an example. A further abstraction of the above data can be made in the form of a metamatrix where each diagonal element represents an entire secondary segment rather than a single atom, and the off-diagonal elements contain all the parameters describing their interrelations. Such matrices can be used in a straightforward search for higher levels of supersecondary structure or used in toto as a representation of the entire tertiary structure of the polypeptide chain.",

(4) Almost all backbone hydrogen bonds are within single elements of secondary structure. An approximate rule of thirds applies: slightly more than one-third (37\%) form i----i--3 hydrogen bonds, almost one-third (32\%) form i----i--4 hydrogen bonds, and slightly less than one-third (26\%) reside in paired strands of beta-sheet. The remaining 5\% are not wholly within an individual helix, turn or sheet. (5) Side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds are clustered at helix-capping positions. (6) An extensive network of hydrogen bonds is present in helices. (7) To a close approximation, the total number of hydrogen bonds is a simple function of a protein's helix and sheet content. (8) A unique quantity, termed the reduced number of hydrogen bonds, is defined as the maximum number of hydrogen bonds possible when every donor:acceptor pair is constrained to be 1:1. This quantity scales linearly with chain length, with 0.71 reduced hydrogen bond per residue. Implications of these results for pathways of protein folding are discussed.",

We have studied the conformational preferences of each amino acid when the amino acid is not constrained to be in a regular secondary structure. In this large but highly restricted coil library, the backbone preferentially adopts dihedral angles consistent with the polyproline II conformation rather than alpha or beta conformations. The preference for the polyproline II conformation is independent of the degree of solvation. In conjunction with a new masking procedure, the frequencies in our coil library accurately recapitulate both helix and sheet frequencies for the amino acids in structured regions, as well as polyproline II propensities. Therefore, structural propensities for alpha-helices and beta-sheets and for polyproline II conformations in unfolded peptides can be rationalized solely by local effects. In addition, these propensities are often strongly affected by both the chemical nature and the conformation of neighboring residues, contrary to the Flory isolated residue hypothesis.",

Evidence is presented for the existence of one such signal, a reciprocal backbone-side-chain hydrogen-bonding interaction, dubbed the capping box. In proteins, the capping box is found uniquely at helix N-termini. In peptides, the capping box can function as a helix stop signal, as shown in the work of Kallenbach and co-workers.",

This review enlarges our earlier hypothesis (Presta LG, Rose GD. 1988. Helix signals in proteins. Science 240:1632-1641) to include hydrophobic capping. A hydrophobic interaction that straddles the helix terminus is always associated with hydrogen-bonded capping. From a global survey among proteins of known structure, seven distinct capping motifs are identified-three at the helix N-terminus and four at the C-terminus. The consensus sequence patterns of these seven motifs, together with results from simple molecular modeling, are used to formulate useful rules of thumb for helix termination.

abstract="An accurate scoring function is a key component for successful protein structure prediction. To address this important unsolved problem, we develop a generalized orientation and distance-dependent all-atom statistical potential. The new statistical potential, generalized orientation-dependent all-atom potential (GOAP), depends on the relative orientation of the planes associated with each heavy atom in interacting pairs. GOAP is a generalization of previous orientation-dependent potentials that consider only representative atoms or blocks of side-chain or polar atoms. GOAP is decomposed into distance- and angle-dependent contributions. The DFIRE distance-scaled finite ideal gas reference state is employed for the distance-dependent component of GOAP. GOAP was tested on 11 commonly used decoy sets containing 278 targets, and recognized 226 native structures as best from the decoys, whereas DFIRE recognized 127 targets. The major improvement comes from decoy sets that have homology-modeled structures that are close to native (all within ∼4.0 {\AA}) or from the ROSETTA ab initio decoy set. For these two kinds of decoys, orientation-independent DFIRE or only side-chain orientation-dependent RWplus performed poorly. Although the OPUS-PSP block-based orientation-dependent, side-chain atom contact potential performs much better (recognizing 196 targets) than DFIRE, RWplus, and dDFIRE, it is still ∼15\% worse than GOAP. Thus, GOAP is a promising advance in knowledge-based, all-atom statistical potentials. GOAP is available for download at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/GOAP.",

In addition, there is a ``twilight zone'' where secondary structure segments depart significantly from the idealized models of Pauling and Corey. For these segments, one has to decide whether the observed structural variations are merely distorsions or whether they constitute a break in the secondary structure.",

abstract="It has long been believed that nucleation of the alpha-helix is a very fast reaction, occurring in around 10(-7) s. We show here that helix nucleation, in fact, takes place on the millisecond time scale. The rate of alpha-helix nucleation in two polyalanine-based peptides and in lysine and glutamic acid homopolymers was measured directly by stopped-flow deep UV CD with synchrotron radiation as the light source. Synchrotron radiation CD gives far superior signal to noise than a conventional instrument. The 16-aa AK peptide folds with first-order kinetics and a rate constant of 15 s-1 at 0 degrees C. The rate-determining step is presumably the initiation of a new helix, which occurs at least 10(5) times slower than expected. Helix folding occurs in at least two steps on the millisecond time scale for the longer peptides, with a transient overshoot of helix content significantly greater than at equilibrium, similar to that seen in the folding of several proteins. We suggest that the overshoot is caused by the formation of a single long helix followed by its breakage into the two or more helices present at equilibrium.",

abstract="While disordered to ordered rearrangements are relatively common, the ability of proteins to switch from one ordered fold to a completely different fold is generally regarded as rare, and few fold switches have been characterized. Here, in a designed system, we examine the mutational requirements for transitioning between folds and functions. We show that switching between monomeric 3$\alpha$ and 4$\beta$+$\alpha$ folds can occur in multiple ways with successive single amino acid changes at diverse residue positions, raising the likelihood that such transitions occur in the evolution of new folds. Even mutations on the periphery of the core can tip the balance between alternatively folded states. Ligand-binding studies illustrate that a new immunoglobulin G-binding function can be gained well before the relevant 4$\beta$+$\alpha$ fold is appreciably populated in the unbound protein. The results provide new insights into the evolution of fold and function.",

If the delta (delta G) values are corrected for differences in side-chain hydrophobicity and conformational entropy, then the estimated stabilization becomes 2.2 kcal/mol per hydrogen bond.

abstract="Much experimental work has been devoted in comparing the folding behavior of proteins sharing the same fold but different sequence. The recent design of proteins displaying very high sequence identities but different 3D structure allows the unique opportunity to address the protein-folding problem from a complementary perspective. Here we explored by $\Phi$-value analysis the pathways of folding of three different heteromorphic pairs, displaying increasingly high-sequence identity (namely, 30\%, 77\%, and 88\%), but different structures called G(A) (a 3-$\alpha$ helix fold) and G(B) (an $\alpha$/$\beta$ fold). The analysis, based on 132 site-directed mutants, is fully consistent with the idea that protein topology is committed very early along the pathway of folding. Furthermore, data reveals that when folding approaches a perfect two-state scenario, as in the case of the G(A) domains, the structural features of the transition state appear very robust to changes in sequence composition. On the other hand, when folding is more complex and multistate, as for the G(B)s, there are alternative nuclei or accessible pathways that can be alternatively stabilized by altering the primary structure. The implications of our results in the light of previous work on the folding of different members belonging to the same protein family are discussed.",

abstract="Sequence comparison is a major step in the prediction of protein structure from existing templates in the Protein Data Bank. The identification of potentially remote homologues to be used as templates for modeling target sequences of unknown structure and their accurate alignment remain challenges, despite many years of study. The most recent advances have been in combining as many sources of information as possible--including amino acid variation in the form of profiles or hidden Markov models for both the target and template families, known and predicted secondary structures of the template and target, respectively, the combination of structure alignment for distant homologues and sequence alignment for close homologues to build better profiles, and the anchoring of certain regions of the alignment based on existing biological data. Newer technologies have been applied to the problem, including the use of support vector machines to tackle the fold classification problem for a target sequence and the alignment of hidden Markov models. Finally, using the consensus of many fold recognition methods, whether based on profile-profile alignments, threading or other approaches, continues to be one of the most successful strategies for both recognition and alignment of remote homologues. Although there is still room for improvement in identification and alignment methods, additional progress may come from model building and refinement methods that can compensate for large structural changes between remotely related targets and templates, as well as for regions of misalignment.",

abstract="Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.",

abstract="In the fifty years since the first atomic structure of a protein was revealed, tens of thousands of additional structures have been solved. Like all objects in biology, proteins structures show common patterns that seem to define family relationships. Classification of proteins structures, which started in the 1970s with about a dozen structures, has continued with increasing enthusiasm, leading to two main fold classifications, SCOP and CATH, as well as many additional databases. Classification is complicated by deciding what constitutes a domain, the fundamental unit of structure. Also difficult is deciding when two given structures are similar. Like all of biology, fold classification is beset by exceptions to all rules. Thus, the perspectives of protein fold space that the fold classifications offer differ from each other. In spite of these ambiguities, fold classifications are useful for prediction of structure and function. Studying the characteristics of fold space can shed light on protein evolution and the physical laws that govern protein behavior.",

abstract="Accurate prediction of protein secondary structure is essential for accurate sequence alignment, three-dimensional structure modeling, and function prediction. The accuracy of ab initio secondary structure prediction from sequence, however, has only increased from around 77 to 80\% over the past decade. Here, we developed a multistep neural-network algorithm by coupling secondary structure prediction with prediction of solvent accessibility and backbone torsion angles in an iterative manner. Our method called SPINE X was applied to a dataset of 2640 proteins (25\% sequence identity cutoff) previously built for the first version of SPINE and achieved a 82.0\% accuracy based on 10-fold cross validation (Q(3)). Surpassing 81\% accuracy by SPINE X is further confirmed by employing an independently built test dataset of 1833 protein chains, a recently built dataset of 1975 proteins and 117 CASP 9 targets (critical assessment of structure prediction techniques) with an accuracy of 81.3\%, 82.3\% and 81.8\%, respectively. The prediction accuracy is further improved to 83.8\% for the dataset of 2640 proteins if the DSSP assignment used above is replaced by a more consistent consensus secondary structure assignment method. Comparison to the popular PSIPRED and CASP-winning structure-prediction techniques is made. SPINE X predicts number of helices and sheets correctly for 21.0\% of 1833 proteins, compared to 17.6\% by PSIPRED. It further shows that SPINE X consistently makes more accurate prediction in helical residues (6\%) without over prediction while PSIPRED makes more accurate prediction in coil residues (3-5\%) and over predicts them by 7\%.

abstract="A complete macromolecule modeling package must be able to solve the simplest structure prediction problems. Despite recent successes in high resolution structure modeling and design, the Rosetta software suite fares poorly on small protein and RNA puzzles, some as small as four residues. To illustrate these problems, this manuscript presents Rosetta results for four well-defined test cases: the 20-residue mini-protein Trp cage, an even smaller disulfide-stabilized conotoxin, the reactive loop of a serine protease inhibitor, and a UUCG RNA tetraloop. In contrast to previous Rosetta studies, several lines of evidence indicate that conformational sampling is not the major bottleneck in modeling these small systems. Instead, approximations and omissions in the Rosetta all-atom energy function currently preclude discriminating experimentally observed conformations from de novo models at atomic resolution. These molecular ``puzzles'' should serve as useful model systems for developers wishing to make foundational improvements to this powerful modeling suite.",

The 10 CASP experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in CASP testing. The nature of CASP targets has been changing in recent CASPs, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.",

abstract="Protein structure prediction is one of the major challenges in bioinformatics today. Throughout the past five decades, many different algorithmic approaches have been attempted, and although progress has been made the problem remains unsolvable even for many small proteins. While the general objective is to predict the three-dimensional structure from primary sequence, our current knowledge and computational power are simply insufficient to solve a problem of such high complexity. Some prediction algorithms do, however, appear to perform better than others, although it is not always obvious which ones they are and it is perhaps even less obvious why that is. In this review, the reported performance results from 18 different recently published prediction algorithms are compared. Furthermore, the general algorithmic settings most likely responsible for the difference in the reported performance are identified, and the specific settings of each of the 18 prediction algorithms are also compared. The average normalized r.m.s.d. scores reported range from 11.17 to 3.48. With a performance measure including both r.m.s.d. scores and CPU time, the currently best-performing prediction algorithm is identified to be the I-TASSER algorithm. Two of the algorithmic settings--protein representation and fragment assembly--were found to have definite positive influence on the running time and the predicted structures, respectively. There thus appears to be a clear benefit from incorporating this knowledge in the design of new prediction algorithms.",

One is a result of the misinterpretation of Anfinsen's Thermodynamic hypothesis which led to the conclusion that the native structure of a protein must be at a global minimum of the Gibbs energy. The second is the result of the adherence to the hydrophobic paradigm, and at the same time ignoring a whole repertoire of hydrophilic effects. It is argued that switching from a target-based to a caused-based approach, and adopting the hydrophilic paradigm leads straightforwardly to a simple answer to Levinthal's question, as well as to a solution of the PFP.

abstract="Protein structure prediction methods such as Rosetta search for the lowest energy conformation of the polypeptide chain. However, the experimentally observed native state is at a minimum of the free energy, rather than the energy. The neglect of the missing configurational entropy contribution to the free energy can be partially justified by the assumption that the entropies of alternative folded states, while very much less than unfolded states, are not too different from one another, and hence can be to a first approximation neglected when searching for the lowest free energy state. The shortcomings of current structure prediction methods may be due in part to the breakdown of this assumption. Particularly problematic are proteins with significant disordered regions which do not populate single low energy conformations even in the native state. We describe two approaches within the Rosetta structure modeling methodology for treating such regions. The first does not require advance knowledge of the regions likely to be disordered; instead these are identified by minimizing a simple free energy function used previously to model protein folding landscapes and transition states. In this model, residues can be either completely ordered or completely disordered; they are considered disordered if the gain in entropy outweighs the loss of favorable energetic interactions with the rest of the protein chain. The second approach requires identification in advance of the disordered regions either from sequence alone using for example the DISOPRED server or from experimental data such as NMR chemical shifts. During Rosetta structure prediction calculations the disordered regions make only unfavorable repulsive contributions to the total energy. We find that the second approach has greater practical utility and illustrate this with examples from de novo structure prediction, NMR structure calculation, and comparative modeling.",

abstract="The study of molecular evolution at the level of protein-coding genes often entails comparing large datasets of sequences to infer their evolutionary relationships. Despite the importance of a protein's structure and conformational dynamics to its function and thus its fitness, common phylogenetic methods embody minimal biophysical knowledge of proteins. To underscore the biophysical constraints on natural selection, we survey effects of protein mutations, highlighting the physical basis for marginal stability of natural globular proteins and how requirement for kinetic stability and avoidance of misfolding and misinteractions might have affected protein evolution. The biophysical underpinnings of these effects have been addressed by models with an explicit coarse-grained spatial representation of the polypeptide chain. Sequence-structure mappings based on such models are powerful conceptual tools that rationalize mutational robustness, evolvability, epistasis, promiscuous function performed by 'hidden' conformational states, resolution of adaptive conflicts and conformational switches in the evolution from one protein fold to another. Recently, protein biophysics has been applied to derive more accurate evolutionary accounts of sequence data. Methods have also been developed to exploit sequence-based evolutionary information to predict biophysical behaviours of proteins. The success of these approaches demonstrates a deep synergy between the fields of protein biophysics and protein evolution.",

abstract="Proteins appear to fold by diverse pathways, but variations of a simple mechanism - nucleation-condensation - describe the overall features of folding of most domains. In general, secondary structure is inherently unstable and its stability is enhanced by tertiary interactions. Consequently, an extensive interplay of secondary and tertiary interactions determines the transition-state for folding, which is structurally similar to the native state, being formed in a general collapse (condensation) around a diffuse nucleus. As the propensity for stable secondary structure increases, folding becomes more hierarchical and eventually follows a framework mechanism where the transition state is assembled from pre-formed secondary structural elements.",

Here, we estimate the combinatorics of self-assembling the protein constituents of a yeast cell, a number so vast that the functional interactome could only have emerged by iterative hierarchic assembly of its component sub-assemblies. A protein can undergo both reversible denaturation and hierarchic self-assembly spontaneously, but a functioning interactome must expend energy to achieve viability. Consequently, it is implausible that a completely ``denatured'' cell could be reversibly renatured spontaneously, like a protein. Instead, new cells are generated by the division of pre-existing cells, an unbroken chain of renewal tracking back through contingent conditions and evolving responses to the origin of life on the prebiotic earth. We surmise that this non-deterministic temporal continuum could not be reconstructed de novo under present conditions.",

abstract="Efficient and accurate reconstruction of secondary structure elements in the context of protein structure prediction is the major focus of this work. We present a novel approach capable of reconstructing alpha-helices and beta-sheets in atomic detail. The method is based on Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations in a force field of empirical potentials that are designed to stabilize secondary structure elements in room-temperature simulations. Particular attention is paid to lateral side-chain interactions in beta-sheets and between the turns of alpha-helices, as well as backbone hydrogen bonding. The force constants are optimized using contrastive divergence, a novel machine learning technique, from a data set of known structures. Using this approach, we demonstrate the applicability of the framework to the problem of reconstructing the overall protein fold for a number of commonly studied small proteins, based on only predicted secondary structure and contact map. For protein G and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, we are able to reconstruct the secondary structure elements in atomic detail and the overall protein folds with a root mean-square deviation of <10 A. For cold-shock protein and the SH3 domain, we accurately reproduce the secondary structure elements and the topology of the 5-stranded beta-sheets, but not the barrel structure. The importance of high-quality secondary structure and contact map prediction is discussed.",

Here, we use a nonredundant set of ultrahigh-resolution protein structures to define these conformation-dependent variations. The trends have a rational, structural basis that can be explained by avoidance of atomic clashes or optimization of favorable electrostatic interactions. To facilitate adoption of this paradigm, we have created a conformation-dependent library of covalent bond lengths and bond angles and shown that it has improved accuracy over existing methods without any additional variables to optimize.

Also, the discovery of protein foldons and their role supplies an essential interpretive link. Recent work using HX pulse labeling with MS analysis finds that a number of proteins fold by stepping through a reproducible sequence of native-like intermediates in an ordered pathway. The stepwise nature of the pathway is dictated by the cooperative foldon unit construction of the protein. The pathway order is determined by a sequential stabilization principle; prior native-like structure guides the formation of adjacent native-like structure. This view does not match the funneled energy landscape paradigm of a very large number of folding tracks, which was framed before foldons were known and is more appropriate for the unguided residue-level search to surmount an initial kinetic barrier rather than for the overall unfolded-state to native-state folding pathway.",

We show that transition paths follow a predictable sequence of high-free-energy transient states that are separated by free-energy barriers. Each transient state corresponds to the assembly of one or more discrete, cooperative units, which are determined directly from the native structure. We show that the transition state on a folding pathway is reached when a small number of critical contacts are formed between a specific set of substructures, after which folding proceeds downhill in free energy. This approach suggests a natural resolution for distinguishing parallel folding pathways and provides a simple means to predict the rate-limiting step in a folding reaction. Our theory identifies a common folding mechanism for proteins with diverse native structures and establishes general principles for the self-assembly of polymers with specific interactions.",

abstract="Previous hydrogen exchange (HX) studies of the spontaneous reversible unfolding of Cytochrome c (Cyt c) under native conditions have led to the following conclusions. Native Cyt c (104 residues) is composed of five cooperative folding units, called foldons. The high-energy landscape is dominated by an energy ladder of partially folded forms that differ from each other by one cooperative foldon unit. The reversible equilibrium unfolding of native Cyt c steps up through these intermediate forms to the unfolded state in an energy-ordered sequence, one foldon unit at a time. To more directly study Cyt c intermediates and pathways during normal energetically downhill kinetic folding, the present work used HX pulse labeling analyzed by a fragment separation-mass spectrometry method. The results show that 95\% or more of the Cyt c population folds by stepping down through the same set of foldon-dependent pathway intermediates as in energetically uphill equilibrium unfolding. These results add to growing evidence that proteins fold through a classical pathway sequence of native-like intermediates rather than through a vast number of undefinable intermediates and pathways. The present results also emphasize the condition-dependent nature of kinetic barriers, which, with less informative experimental methods (fluorescence, etc.), are often confused with variability in intermediates and pathways.",

In this work, we investigate the mechanical properties of 70 protein structures belonging to 14 protein families presenting various folds using coarse-grain Brownian dynamics simulations. The resulting rigidity profiles combined with multiple sequence alignments show that a limited set of rigid residues, which we call the consensus nucleus, occupy conserved positions along the protein sequence. These residues' side chains form a tight interaction network within the protein's core, thus making our consensus nuclei potential folding nuclei. A review of experimental and theoretical literature shows that most (above 80\%) of these residues were indeed identified as folding nucleus member in earlier studies.",

abstract="In order to solve the immensely difficult protein-folding problem, it will be necessary to characterize the barriers that slow folding and the intermediate structures that promote it. Although protein-folding intermediates are not accessible to the usual structural studies, hydrogen exchange (HX) methods have been able to detect and characterize intermediates in both kinetic and equilibrium modes--as transient kinetic folding intermediates on a subsecond time scale, as labile equilibrium molten globule intermediates under destabilizing conditions, and as infinitesimally populated intermediates in the high free-energy folding landscape under native conditions. Available results consistently indicate that protein-folding landscapes are dominated by a small number of discrete, metastable, native-like partially unfolded forms (PUFs). The PUFs appear to be produced, one from another, by the unfolding and refolding of the protein's intrinsically cooperative secondary structural elements, which can spontaneously create stepwise unfolding and refolding pathways. Kinetic experiments identify three kinds of barrier processes: (a) an initial intrinsic search-nucleation-collapse process that prepares the chain for intermediate formation by pinning it into a condensed coarsely native-like topology; (b) smaller search-dependent barriers that put the secondary structural units into place; and (c) optional error-dependent misfold-reorganization barriers that can cause slow folding, intermediate accumulation, and folding heterogeneity. These conclusions provide a coherent explanation for the grossly disparate folding behavior of different globular proteins in terms of distinct folding pathways.",

The ability to predict the DNA binding preferences of these regulatory proteins from their amino acid sequence would greatly aid in reconstruction of their regulatory interactions. Structural modeling provides one route to such predictions: by building accurate molecular models of regulatory proteins in complex with candidate binding sites, and estimating their relative binding affinities for these sites using a suitable potential function, it should be possible to construct DNA binding profiles. Here, we present a novel molecular modeling protocol for protein-DNA interfaces that borrows conformational sampling techniques from de novo protein structure prediction to generate a diverse ensemble of structural models from small fragments of related and unrelated protein-DNA complexes. The extensive conformational sampling is coupled with sequence space exploration so that binding preferences for the target protein can be inferred from the resulting optimized DNA sequences. We apply the algorithm to predict binding profiles for a benchmark set of eleven C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, five of known and six of unknown structure. The predicted profiles are in good agreement with experimental binding data; furthermore, examination of the modeled structures gives insight into observed binding preferences.",

Our analysis shows that the larger units are combinations of smaller units, giving rise to a structural hierarchy ranging from the whole protein monomer through supersecondary structures down to individual helices and strands. It turns out that there is more than one way to assemble the protein by self-association of its compact units. However, the number of possible pathways is small--small enough to be exhaustively explored by a computer program. The hierarchic organization of compact units in protein molecules is consistent with a model for folding by hierarchic condensation. In this model, neighboring hydrophobic chain sites interact to form folding clusters, with further stepwise cluster association giving rise to a population of folding intermediates.",

Given a protein sequence, at the first stage of the prediction scheme, we propose cutting the sequence into structurally assigned BBs. Next, we perform a combinatorial assembly and attempt to predict the relative three-dimensional arrangement of the BBs. In the third stage, we refine and rank the assemblies. The scheme has proven to be very promising in reducing the complexity of the protein folding problem and gaining insight into the protein folding process.

In this context, we report here a systematic investigation on the step-wise formation of a helical structure by the addition of hexafluoroacetone, in a 14-residue peptide derived from a part of the scorpion neurotoxin protein. The NMR and circular dichroism results indicate that the peptide has an inherent propensity for helix formation and this is limited to the internal few residues in aqueous solution. With the addition of the fluorosolvent, the helical content progressively increases and spans the whole sequence. This is accompanied by concomitant packing of the side chains.

To probe the role of this intermediate in the folding of RNase H, the folding kinetics of mutant proteins with altered native state stabilities were investigated. Mutations within the folding core destabilize the kinetic intermediate and slow refolding in a manner consistent with an obligatory intermediate model. Mutations outside of the folding core, however, do not affect the stability of the kinetic intermediate but do perturb the native state and transition state. These results indicate that interactions formed in the intermediate persist in the transition and native states and that RNase H folds through a hierarchical mechanism.",

Although experimental structure determination methods are providing high-resolution structure information about a subset of the proteins, computational structure prediction methods will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose structures will not be determined experimentally. The first class of protein structure prediction methods, including threading and comparative modeling, rely on detectable similarity spanning most of the modeled sequence and at least one known structure. The second class of methods, de novo or ab initio methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on similarity at the fold level between the modeled sequence and any of the known structures. In this Viewpoint, we begin by describing the essential features of the methods, the accuracy of the models, and their application to the prediction and understanding of protein function, both for single proteins and on the scale of whole genomes. We then discuss the important role that protein structure prediction methods play in the growing worldwide effort in structural genomics.",

abstract="Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder order transition called ``folding.'' The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.",

In this chapter, we described several methods routinely used to compare computational models to experimental answers in several modeling assessments. The two major classes of measures, positional distance-based and contact-based, are presented, compared, and analyzed. The most popular measure of the first class, the global RMSD, is shown to be the least representative of the degree of structural similarity because it is dominated by the largest error. Several distance-dependent algorithms designed to attenuate the drawbacks of RMSD are described. Measures of the second class, contact-based, are shown to be more robust and relevant. We also illustrate the importance of using combined measures, utility-based measures, and the role of the distributions derived from the pairs of experimental structures in interpreting the results.",

abstract="Various host-guest peptide series are used by experimentalists as reference conformational states. One such use is as a baseline for random-coil NMR chemical shifts. Comparison to this random-coil baseline, through secondary chemical shifts, is used to infer protein secondary structure. The use of these random-coil data sets rests on the perception that the reference chemical shifts arise from states where there is little or no conformational bias. However, there is growing evidence that the conformational composition of natively and nonnatively unfolded proteins fail to approach anything that can be construed as random coil. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of an alanine-based host-guest peptide series (AAXAA) as a model of unfolded and denatured states to examine the intrinsic propensities of the amino acids. We produced ensembles that are in good agreement with the experimental NMR chemical shifts and confirm that the sampling of the 20 natural amino acids in this peptide series is be far from random. Preferences toward certain regions of conformational space were both present and dependent upon the environment when compared under conditions typically used to denature proteins, i.e., thermal and chemical denaturation. Moreover, the simulations allowed us to examine the conformational makeup of the underlying ensembles giving rise to the ensemble-averaged chemical shifts. We present these data as an intrinsic backbone propensity library that forms part of our Structural Library of Intrinsic Residue Propensities to inform model building, to aid in interpretation of experiment, and for structure prediction of natively and nonnatively unfolded states.",

abstract="The kinetic folding of ribonuclease H was studied by hydrogen exchange (HX) pulse labeling with analysis by an advanced fragment separation mass spectrometry technology. The results show that folding proceeds through distinct intermediates in a stepwise pathway that sequentially incorporates cooperative native-like structural elements to build the native protein. Each step is seen as a concerted transition of one or more segments from an HX-unprotected to an HX-protected state. Deconvolution of the data to near amino acid resolution shows that each step corresponds to the folding of a secondary structural element of the native protein, termed a ``foldon.'' Each folded segment is retained through subsequent steps of foldon addition, revealing a stepwise buildup of the native structure via a single dominant pathway. Analysis of the pertinent literature suggests that this model is consistent with experimental results for many proteins and some current theoretical results. Two biophysical principles appear to dictate this behavior. The principle of cooperativity determines the central role of native-like foldon units. An interaction principle termed ``sequential stabilization'' based on native-like interfoldon interactions orders the pathway.",

The term refers to three broad questions: (i) What is the physical code by which an amino acid sequence dictates a protein's native structure? (ii) How can proteins fold so fast? (iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days. What began as three questions of basic science one half-century ago has now grown into the full-fledged research field of protein physical science.",

They make use of a probabilistic model, learnt from the promising solutions, to guide the search process. In this paper, we set out a basic taxonomy of EDA techniques, underlining the nature and complexity of the probabilistic model of each EDA variant.

We compiled a comprehensive data set of early folding residues based on pulsed labeling hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments. These early folding residues have corresponding higher backbone rigidity as predicted by DynaMine from sequence, an effect also present when accounting for the secondary structures in the folded protein. We then show that the amino acids involved in early folding events are not more conserved than others, but rather, early folding fragments and the secondary structure elements they are part of show a clear trend toward conserving a rigid backbone. We therefore propose that backbone rigidity is a fundamental physical feature conserved by proteins that can provide important insights into their folding mechanisms and stability.",

To achieve fine control over protein shape and size within a particular topology, we have extended the design rules by systematically analyzing the codependencies between the lengths and packing geometry of successive secondary structure elements and the backbone torsion angles of the loop linking them. We demonstrate the control afforded by the resulting extended rule set by designing a series of proteins with the same fold but considerable variation in secondary structure length, loop geometry, $\beta$-strand registry, and overall shape. Solution NMR structures of four designed proteins for two different folds show that protein shape and size can be precisely controlled within a given protein fold.

abstract="Measurements of protection against exchange of main chain amide hydrogens (NH) with solvent hydrogens in globular proteins have provided remarkable insights into the structures of rare high-energy states that populate their folding free-energy surfaces. Lacking, however, has been a unifying theory that rationalizes these high-energy states in terms of the structures and sequences of their resident proteins. The Branched Aliphatic Side Chain (BASiC) hypothesis has been developed to explain the observed patterns of protection in a pair of TIM barrel proteins. This hypothesis supposes that the side chains of isoleucine, leucine, and valine (ILV) residues often form large hydrophobic clusters that very effectively impede the penetration of water to their underlying hydrogen bond networks and, thereby, enhance the protection against solvent exchange. The linkage between the secondary and tertiary structures enables these ILV clusters to serve as cores of stability in high-energy partially folded states. Statistically significant correlations between the locations of large ILV clusters in native conformations and strong protection against exchange for a variety of motifs reported in the literature support the generality of the BASiC hypothesis. The results also illustrate the necessity to elaborate this simple hypothesis to account for the roles of adjacent hydrocarbon moieties in defining stability cores of partially folded states along folding reaction coordinates.",

abstract="The present review focuses on the evolution of proteins and the impact of amino acid mutations on function from a structural perspective. Proteins evolve under the law of natural selection and undergo alternating periods of conservative evolution and of relatively rapid change. The likelihood of mutations being fixed in the genome depends on various factors, such as the fitness of the phenotype or the position of the residues in the three-dimensional structure. For example, co-evolution of residues located close together in three-dimensional space can occur to preserve global stability. Whereas point mutations can fine-tune the protein function, residue insertions and deletions ('decorations' at the structural level) can sometimes modify functional sites and protein interactions more dramatically. We discuss recent developments and tools to identify such episodic mutations, and examine their applications in medical research. Such tools have been tested on simulated data and applied to real data such as viruses or animal sequences. Traditionally, there has been little if any cross-talk between the fields of protein biophysics, protein structure-function and molecular evolution. However, the last several years have seen some exciting developments in combining these approaches to obtain an in-depth understanding of how proteins evolve. For example, a better understanding of how structural constraints affect protein evolution will greatly help us to optimize our models of sequence evolution. The present review explores this new synthesis of perspectives.",

The extrapolation of the concepts and methodologies developed for the study of species co-evolution at the molecular level has prompted the development of a variety of computational methods able to predict protein interactions through the characteristics of co-evolution. Particularly successful have been those methods that predict interactions at the genomic level based on the detection of pairs of protein families with similar evolutionary histories (similarity of phylogenetic trees: mirrortree). Future advances in this field will require a better understanding of the molecular basis of the co-evolution of protein families. Thus, it will be important to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying the similarity observed in phylogenetic trees of interacting proteins, distinguishing direct specific molecular interactions from other general functional constraints. In particular, it will be important to separate the effects of physical interactions within protein complexes ('co-adaptation') from other forces that, in a less specific way, can also create general patterns of co-evolution.",

abstract="Studies of interacting proteins have found correlated evolution of the sequences of binding partners, apparently as a result of compensating mutations to maintain specificity (i.e., molecular coevolution). Here, we analyze the coevolution of interacting proteins in yeast and demonstrate correlated evolution of binding partners in eukaryotes. Detailed investigation of this apparent coevolution, focusing on the proteins' surface and binding interface, surprisingly leads to no improvement in the correlation. We conclude that true coevolution, as characterized by compensatory mutations between binding partners, is unlikely to be chiefly responsible for the apparent correlated evolution. We postulate that the correlation between sequence alignments is simply due to interacting proteins being subject to similar constraints on their evolutionary rate. Because gene expression has a strong influence on evolutionary rate, and interacting proteins will tend to have similar levels of expression, we investigated this particular constraint. We found that the absolute expression level outperformed correlated evolution for predicting interacting protein partners. A correlation between sequence alignments could also be identified not only between pairs of proteins that physically interact but also between those that are merely functionally related (i.e., within the same protein complex). This indicates that the observed correlated evolution of interacting proteins is due to similar constraints on evolutionary rate and not coevolution.",

abstract="Most studies of protein networks operate on a high level of abstraction, neglecting structural and chemical aspects of each interaction. Here, we characterize interactions by using atomic-resolution information from three-dimensional protein structures. We find that some previously recognized relationships between network topology and genomic features (e.g., hubs tending to be essential proteins) are actually more reflective of a structural quantity, the number of distinct binding interfaces. Subdividing hubs with respect to this quantity provides insight into their evolutionary rate and indicates that additional mechanisms of network growth are active in evolution (beyond effective preferential attachment through gene duplication).",

abstract="Protein-protein interactions effectively mediate molecular function. They are the result of specific interactions between protein interfaces and are maintained by the action of evolutionary pressure on the regions of the interacting proteins that contribute to binding. For the most part, selection restricts amino acid replacements, accounting for the conservation of binding interfaces. However, in some cases, change in one protein will be mitigated by compensatory change in its binding partner, maintaining function in the face of evolutionary change. There have been several attempts to use correlations in sequence evolution to predict interactions of proteins. Most commonly, these approaches use the entire sequence to identify correlations and so infer probable binding. However, other factors such as shared evolutionary history and similarities in the rates of evolution confound these whole-sequence-based approaches. Here, we discuss recent work on this topic and argue that both site-specific coevolutionary change and whole-sequence evolution contribute to evolutionary signals in sets of interacting proteins. We discuss the relative effects of both types of selection and how they might be identified. This permits an integrated view of protein-protein interactions, their evolution, and coevolution.",

abstract="We have estimated the selective effects of amino acid replacements in natural populations by comparing levels of polymorphism in 91 genes in African populations of Drosophila melanogaster with their divergence from Drosophila simulans. The genes include about equal numbers whose level of expression in adults is greater in males, greater in females, or approximately equal in the sexes. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were used to sample key parameters in the stationary distribution of polymorphism and divergence in a model in which the selective effect of each nonsynonymous mutation is regarded as a random sample from some underlying normal distribution whose mean may differ from one gene to the next. Our analysis suggests that approximately 95\% of all nonsynonymous mutations that could contribute to polymorphism or divergence are deleterious, and that the average proportion of deleterious amino acid polymorphisms in samples is approximately 70\%. On the other hand, approximately 95\% of fixed differences between species are positively selected, although the scaled selection coefficient (N(e)s) is very small. We estimate that approximately 46\% of amino acid replacements have N(e)s < 2, approximately 84\% have N(e)s < 4, and approximately 99\% have N(e)s < 7. Although positive selection among amino acid differences between species seems pervasive, most of the selective effects could be regarded as nearly neutral. There are significant differences in selection between sex-biased and unbiased genes, which relate primarily to the mean of the distributions of mutational effects and the fraction of slightly deleterious and weakly beneficial mutations that are fixed.",

abstract="Class I major histocompatibility complex proteins play a critical role in the adaptive immune system by binding to peptides derived from cytosolic proteins and presenting them on the cell surface for surveillance by T cells. The varied peptide binding specificity of these highly polymorphic molecules has important consequences for vaccine design, transplantation, autoimmunity, and cancer development. Here, we describe a molecular modeling study of MHC-peptide interactions that integrates sampling techniques from protein-protein docking, loop modeling, de novo structure prediction, and protein design in order to construct atomically detailed peptide binding landscapes for a diverse set of MHC proteins. Specificity profiles derived from these landscapes recover key features of experimental binding profiles and can be used to predict peptide binding with reasonable accuracy. Family wide comparison of the predicted binding landscapes recapitulates previously reported patterns of specificity divergence and peptide-repertoire diversity while providing a structural basis for observed specificity patterns. The size and sequence diversity of these structure-based binding landscapes enable us to identify subtle patterns of covariation between peptide sequence positions; analysis of the associated structural models suggests physical interactions that may mediate these sequence correlations.",

abstract="The p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) domain that undergoes coupled folding and binding when interacting with partner proteins like the E3 ligase, MDM2, and the 70 kDa subunit of replication protein A, RPA70. The secondary structure and dynamics of six closely related mammalian homologues of p53TAD were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Differences in both transient secondary structure and backbone dynamics were observed for the homologues. Many of these differences were localized to the binding sites for MDM2 and RPA70. The amount of transient helical secondary structure observed for the MDM2 binding site was lower for the dog and mouse homologues, compared with human, and the amount of transient helical secondary structure observed for the RPA70 binding site was higher for guinea pig and rabbit, compared with human. Differences in the amount of transient helical secondary structure observed for the MDM2 binding site were directly related to amino acid substitutions occurring on the solvent exposed side of the amphipathic helix that forms during the p53TAD/MDM2 interaction. Differences in the amount of transient helical secondary structure were not as easily explained for the RPA70 binding site because of its extensive sequence divergence. Clustering analysis shows that the divergence in the transient secondary structure of the p53TAD homologues exceeds the amino acid sequence divergence. In contrast, strong correlations were observed between the backbone dynamics of the homologues and the sequence identity matrix, suggesting that the dynamic behavior of IDPs is a conserved evolutionary feature.",

abstract="The need to maintain the structural and functional integrity of an evolving protein severely restricts the repertoire of acceptable amino-acid substitutions. However, it is not known whether these restrictions impose a global limit on how far homologous protein sequences can diverge from each other. Here we explore the limits of protein evolution using sequence divergence data. We formulate a computational approach to study the rate of divergence of distant protein sequences and measure this rate for ancient proteins, those that were present in the last universal common ancestor. We show that ancient proteins are still diverging from each other, indicating an ongoing expansion of the protein sequence universe. The slow rate of this divergence is imposed by the sparseness of functional protein sequences in sequence space and the ruggedness of the protein fitness landscape: approximately 98 per cent of sites cannot accept an amino-acid substitution at any given moment but a vast majority of all sites may eventually be permitted to evolve when other, compensatory, changes occur. Thus, approximately 3.5 x 10(9) yr has not been enough to reach the limit of divergent evolution of proteins, and for most proteins the limit of sequence similarity imposed by common function may not exceed that of random sequences.",

In the present article, we examine restraints on sequence, which arise from selectively advantageous roles for structure and function and which lead to the conservation of local sequences and structures in families and superfamilies. We analyse structurally aligned members of protein families and superfamilies in order to investigate the importance of the local structural environment of amino acid residues in the acceptance of amino acid substitutions during protein evolution. We show that solvent accessibility is the most important determinant, followed by the existence of hydrogen bonds from the side-chain to main-chain functions and the nature of the element of secondary structure to which the amino acid contributes. Polar side chains whose hydrogen-bonding potential is satisfied tend to be more conserved than their unsatisfied or non-hydrogen-bonded counterparts, and buried and satisfied polar residues tend to be significantly more conserved than buried hydrophobic residues. Finally, we discuss the importance of functional restraints in the form of interactions of proteins with other macromolecules in assemblies or with substrates, ligands or allosteric regulators. We show that residues involved in such functional interactions are significantly more conserved and have differing amino acid substitution patterns.",

This follows upon our previous work in assessing nine representations of backbone geometry.1 The alphabet found to be most effective overall has seven states and is based on a count of C(beta) atoms within a 14 A-radius sphere centered at the C(beta) of a residue of interest. When incorporated into a hidden Markov model (HMM), this alphabet gave us a 38\% performance boost in fold recognition and 23\% in alignment quality.",

abstract="One of the most widely accepted ideas related to the evolutionary rates of proteins is that functionally important residues or regions evolve slower than other regions, a reasonable outcome of which should be a slower evolutionary rate of the proteins with a higher density of functionally important sites. Oddly, the role of functional importance, mainly measured by essentiality, in determining evolutionary rate has been challenged in recent studies. Several variables other than protein essentiality, such as expression level, gene compactness, protein-protein interactions, etc., have been suggested to affect protein evolutionary rate. In the present review, we try to refine the concept of functional importance of a gene, and consider three factors-functional importance, expression level, and gene compactness, as independent determinants of evolutionary rate of a protein, based not only on their known correlation with evolutionary rate but also on a reasonable mechanistic model. We suggest a framework based on these mechanistic models to correctly interpret the correlations between evolutionary rates and the various variables as well as the interrelationships among the variables.",

abstract="Kinetic folding of the large two-domain maltose binding protein (MBP; 370 residues) was studied at high structural resolution by an advanced hydrogen-exchange pulse-labeling mass-spectrometry method (HX MS). Dilution into folding conditions initiates a fast molecular collapse into a polyglobular conformation (<20 ms), determined by various methods including small angle X-ray scattering. The compaction produces a structurally heterogeneous state with widespread low-level HX protection and spectroscopic signals that match the equilibrium melting posttransition-state baseline. In a much slower step (7-s time constant), all of the MBP molecules, although initially heterogeneously structured, form the same distinct helix plus sheet folding intermediate with the same time constant. The intermediate is composed of segments that are distant in the MBP sequence but adjacent in the native protein where they close the longest residue-to-residue contact. Segments that are most HX protected in the early molecular collapse do not contribute to the initial intermediate, whereas the segments that do participate are among the less protected. The 7-s intermediate persists through the rest of the folding process. It contains the sites of three previously reported destabilizing mutations that greatly slow folding. These results indicate that the intermediate is an obligatory step on the MBP folding pathway. MBP then folds to the native state on a longer time scale ({\textasciitilde}100 s), suggestively in more than one step, the first of which forms structure adjacent to the 7-s intermediate. These results add a large protein to the list of proteins known to fold through distinct native-like intermediates in distinct pathways.",

abstract="Some protein design tasks cannot be modeled by the traditional single state design strategy of finding a sequence that is optimal for a single fixed backbone. Such cases require multistate design, where a single sequence is threaded onto multiple backbones (states) and evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses on each backbone. For example, to design a protein that can switch between two specific conformations, it is necessary to to find a sequence that is compatible with both backbone conformations. We present in this paper a generic implementation of multistate design that is suited for a wide range of protein design tasks and demonstrate in silico its capabilities at two design tasks: one of redesigning an obligate homodimer into an obligate heterodimer such that the new monomers would not homodimerize, and one of redesigning a promiscuous interface to bind to only a single partner and to no longer bind the rest of its partners. Both tasks contained negative design in that multistate design was asked to find sequences that would produce high energies for several of the states being modeled. Success at negative design was assessed by computationally redocking the undesired protein-pair interactions; we found that multistate design's accuracy improved as the diversity of conformations for the undesired protein-pair interactions increased. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pitfalls of negative design, which has proven considerably more challenging than positive design.",

abstract="Protein-protein interactions lie at the heart of most cellular processes. Many experimental and computational studies aim to deepen our understanding of these interactions and improve our capacity to predict them. In this respect, the evolutionary perspective is most interesting, since the preservation of structure and function puts constraints on the evolution of proteins and their interactions. However, uncovering these constraints remains a challenge, and the description and detection of evolutionary signals in protein-protein interactions is currently a very active field of research. Here, we review recent works dissecting the mechanisms of protein-protein interaction evolution and exploring how to use evolutionary information to predict interactions, both at the global level of the interactome and at the detailed level of protein-protein interfaces. We first present to what extent protein-protein interactions are found to be conserved within interactomes and which properties can influence their conservation. We then discuss the evolutionary and co-evolutionary pressures applied on protein-protein interfaces. Finally, we describe how the computational prediction of interfaces can benefit from evolutionary inputs.",

abstract="Amide hydrogen exchange (HX) is widely used in protein biophysics even though our ignorance about the HX mechanism makes data interpretation imprecise. Notably, the open exchange-competent conformational state has not been identified. Based on analysis of an ultralong molecular dynamics trajectory of the protein BPTI, we propose that the open (O) states for amides that exchange by subglobal fluctuations are locally distorted conformations with two water molecules directly coordinated to the N-H group. The HX protection factors computed from the relative O-state populations agree well with experiment. The O states of different amides show little or no temporal correlation, even if adjacent residues unfold cooperatively. The mean residence time of the O state is ∼100 ps for all examined amides, so the large variation in measured HX rate must be attributed to the opening frequency. A few amides gain solvent access via tunnels or pores penetrated by water chains including native internal water molecules, but most amides access solvent by more local structural distortions. In either case, we argue that an overcoordinated N-H group is necessary for efficient proton transfer by Grotthuss-type structural diffusion.",

abstract="Biological processes are the result of noncovalent, protein-ligand interactions, where the ligands range from small organic and inorganic molecules to lipids, nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins. Amide groups within proteins constantly exchange protons with water. When immersed in heavy water (D2O), mass spectrometry (MS) can measure the change of mass associated with the hydrogen to deuterium exchange (HDX). Protein-ligand interactions modify the hydrogen exchange rates of amide protons, and the measurement of the amide exchange rates can provide rich information regarding the dynamical structure of the protein-ligand complex. This chapter describes a protocol for conducting bottom-up, continuous uptake, proteolytic fragmentation HDX-MS experiments that can help identify and map the interacting peptides of a protein-ligand interface. This tutorial outlines the fundamental theory governing hydrogen exchange; provides practical information regarding the preparation of protein samples and solutions; and describes the exchange reaction, reaction quenching, enzymatic digestion, chromatographic separation, and peptide analysis by MS. Tables list representative combinations of fluidic components used by HDX-MS researchers and summarize the available HDX-MS analysis software packages. Additionally, two HDX-MS case studies are used to illustrate protein-ligand interactions involving: (1) a continuous sequence of interacting residues and (2) a set of discontinuously numbered residues, residing spatially near each other.",

abstract="How do proteins fold so quickly? Some denatured proteins fold to their native structures in only microseconds, on average, implying that there is a folding ``mechanism,'' i.e., a particular set of events by which the protein short-circuits a broader conformational search. Predicting protein structures using atomically detailed physical models is currently challenging. The most definitive proof of a putative folding mechanism would be whether it speeds up protein structure prediction in physical models. In the zipping and assembly (ZA) mechanism, local structuring happens first at independent sites along the chain, then those structures either grow (zip) or coalescence (assemble) with other structures. Here, we apply the ZA search mechanism to protein native structure prediction by using the AMBER96 force field with a generalized Born/surface area implicit solvent model and sampling by replica exchange molecular dynamics. Starting from open denatured conformations, our algorithm, called the ZA method, converges to an average of 2.2 A from the Protein Data Bank native structures of eight of nine proteins that we tested, which ranged from 25 to 73 aa in length. In addition, experimental Phi values, where available on these proteins, are consistent with the predicted routes. We conclude that ZA is a viable model for how proteins physically fold. The present work also shows that physics-based force fields are quite good and that physics-based protein structure prediction may be practical, at least for some small proteins.",

abstract="Hydrogen exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) has become a valuable analytical tool for the study of protein dynamics. By combining information about protein dynamics with more classical functional data, a more thorough understanding of protein function can be obtained. In many cases, protein dynamics are directly related to specific protein functions such as conformational changes during enzyme activation or protein movements during binding. The method is made possible because labile backbone hydrogens in a protein will exchange with deuterium atoms when the protein is placed in a D2O solution. The subsequent increase in protein mass over time is measured with high-resolution MS. The location of the deuterium incorporation is determined by monitoring deuterium incorporation in peptic fragments that are produced after the labeling reaction. In this review, we will summarize the general principles of the method, discuss the latest variations on the experimental protocol that probe different types of protein movements, and review other recent work and improvements in the field.",

Here, we use a clustering algorithm to analyze 76,533 all-trans segments from protein structures solved at 1.2 {\AA} resolution or better to create a purely $\phi$,$\psi$-based comprehensive empirical categorization of common conformations adopted by two adjacent $\phi$,$\psi$ pairs (i.e., ($\phi$,$\psi$)(2) motifs). The clustering algorithm works in an origin-shifted four-dimensional space based on the two $\phi$,$\psi$ pairs to yield a parameter-dependent list of ($\phi$,$\psi$)(2) motifs, in order of their prominence. The results are remarkably distinct from and complementary to the standard hydrogen-bond-centered view of secondary structure. New insights include an unprecedented level of precision in describing the $\phi$,$\psi$ angles of both previously known and novel motifs, ordering of these motifs by their population density, a data-driven recommendation that the standard C($\alpha$(i))\ldotsC($\alpha$(i+3))<7 {\AA} criteria for defining turns be changed to 6.5 {\AA}, identification of $\beta$-strand and turn capping motifs, and identification of conformational capping by residues in polypeptide II conformation. We further document that the conformational preferences of a residue are substantially influenced by the conformation of its neighbors, and we suggest that accounting for these dependencies will improve protein modeling accuracy. Although the CUEVAS-4D(r(10)є(14)) 'parts list' presented here is only an initial exploration of the complex ($\phi$,$\psi$)(2) landscape of proteins, it shows that there is value to be had from this approach, and it opens the door to more in-depth characterizations at the ($\phi$,$\psi$)(2) level and at higher dimensions.",

abstract="In protein fold recognition, a probe amino acid sequence is compared to a library of representative folds of known structure to identify a structural homolog. In cases where the probe and its homolog have clear sequence similarity, traditional residue substitution matrices have been used to predict the structural similarity. In cases where the probe is sequentially distant from its homolog, we have developed a (7 x 3 x 2 x 7 x 3) 3D-1D substitution matrix (called H3P2), calculated from a database of 119 structural pairs. Members of each pair share a similar fold, but have sequence identity less than 30\%. Each probe sequence position is defined by one of seven residue classes and three secondary structure classes. Each homologous fold position is defined by one of seven residue classes, three secondary structure classes, and two burial classes. Thus the matrix is five-dimensional and contains 7 x 3 x 2 x 7 x 3 = 882 elements or 3D-1D scores. The first step in assigning a probe sequence to its homologous fold is the prediction of the three-state (helix, strand, coil) secondary structure of the probe; here we use the profile based neural network prediction of secondary structure (PHD) program. Then a dynamic programming algorithm uses the H3P2 matrix to align the probe sequence with structures in a representative fold library. To test the effectiveness of the H3P2 matrix a challenging, fold class diverse, and cross-validated benchmark assessment is used to compare the H3P2 matrix to the GONNET, PAM250, BLOSUM62 and a secondary structure only substitution matrix. For distantly related sequences the H3P2 matrix detects more homologous structures at higher reliabilities than do these other substitution matrices, based on sensitivity versus specificity plots (or SENS-SPEC plots). The added efficacy of the H3P2 matrix arises from its information on the statistical preferences for various sequence-structure environment combinations from very distantly related proteins. It introduces the predicted secondary structure information from a sequence into fold recognition in a statistical way that normalizes the inherent correlations between residue type, secondary structure and solvent accessibility.",

Here, we show that spectroscopic studies of a complete library of 400 dipeptides reveal that, irrespective of side-chain properties, the backbone conformation distribution is narrow and they adopt polyproline II and $\beta$-strand, indicating the importance of backbone peptide solvation and electronic effects. By directly comparing the dipeptide circular dichroism and NMR results with those of unfolded proteins, the comprehensive dipeptides form a complete set of structural motifs of unfolded proteins. We thus anticipate that the present dipeptide library with spectroscopic data can serve as a useful database for understanding the nature of unfolded protein structures and for further refinements of molecular mechanical parameters.",

Forward genetics was used to identify an Arabidopsis mutant with altered plant architecture. Using genetic and molecular approaches, we analyzed the roles of a mutated cyclophilin in the control of plant architecture. The Arabidopsis mutant roc1 has reduced stem elongation and increased shoot branching, and the mutant phenotypes are strongly affected by temperature and photoperiod. Map-based cloning and transgenic experiments demonstrated that the roc1 mutant phenotypes are caused by a gain-of-function mutation in a cyclophilin gene, ROC1. Besides, application of the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) further suppresses stem elongation in the mutant. GA treatment enhances the accumulation of mutated but not of wildtype (WT) ROC1 proteins. The roc1 mutation does not seem to interfere with GA biosynthesis or signaling. GA signaling, however, antagonizes the effect of the roc1 mutation on stem elongation. The altered plant architecture may result from the activation of an R gene by the roc1 protein. We also present a working model for the interaction between the roc1 mutation and GA signaling in regulating stem elongation.",

It is highly desirable that such scoring function is independent of the sizes of proteins in comparison so that the significance of alignment across different sizes of the protein regions aligned is comparable.

We further built a program called SPalign that optimizes SP-score for structure alignment. SPalign was applied to recognize proteins within the same structure fold and having the same function of DNA or RNA binding. For fold discrimination, SPalign improves sensitivity over TMalign for the chain-level comparison by 12\% and over DALI for the domain-level comparison by 13\% at the same specificity of 99.6\%. The difference between TMalign and SPalign at the chain level is due to the inability of TMalign to detect single domain similarity between multidomain proteins. For recognizing nucleic acid binding proteins, SPalign consistently improves over TMalign by 12\% and DALI by 31\% in average value of Mathews correlation coefficients for four datasets. SPalign with default setting is 14\% faster than TMalign. SPalign is expected to be useful for function prediction and comparing structures with or without domains defined.

abstract="It is argued that the chemical nature of the polypeptide backbone is the central determinant of the three-dimensional structures of proteins. The requirement that buried polar groups form intramolecular hydrogen bonds limits the fold of the backbone to the well known units of secondary structure while the amino acid sequence chooses among the set of conformations available to the backbone. 'Sidechain-only' models, based for example on hydrophobicity patterns, fail to account for the properties of the backbone and thus will have difficulty capturing essential features of a folding pathway. This is evident from the incorrect predictions they make for the conformations of the limiting cases of all-hydrophobic or all-polar sequences.",

abstract="Some protein design tasks cannot be modeled by the traditional single state design strategy of finding a sequence that is optimal for a single fixed backbone. Such cases require multistate design, where a single sequence is threaded onto multiple backbones (states) and evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses on each backbone. For example, to design a protein that can switch between two specific conformations, it is necessary to to find a sequence that is compatible with both backbone conformations. We present in this paper a generic implementation of multistate design that is suited for a wide range of protein design tasks and demonstrate in silico its capabilities at two design tasks: one of redesigning an obligate homodimer into an obligate heterodimer such that the new monomers would not homodimerize, and one of redesigning a promiscuous interface to bind to only a single partner and to no longer bind the rest of its partners. Both tasks contained negative design in that multistate design was asked to find sequences that would produce high energies for several of the states being modeled. Success at negative design was assessed by computationally redocking the undesired protein-pair interactions; we found that multistate design's accuracy improved as the diversity of conformations for the undesired protein-pair interactions increased. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pitfalls of negative design, which has proven considerably more challenging than positive design",

abstract="beta-Turns have been extracted from 59 non-identical proteins (resolution 2 A) using the standard criterion that the distance between C alpha (i) and C alpha (i + 3) is less than 7 A (1 A = 0.1 nm). The beta-turns have been classified, using phi, psi angles, into seven conventional turn types (I, I', II, II', IV, VIa, VIb) and a new class of beta-turn, designated type VIII, in which the central residues (i + 1, i + 2) adopt an alpha R beta conformation. Most beta-turn types are found in various topological environments, with the exception of I' and II' beta-turns, where 83\% and 50\%, respectively, are found in beta-hairpins. Sufficient data have been gathered to enable, for the first time, the separate statistical analysis of type I and II beta-turns. The two turn types have been shown to be strikingly different in their sequence preferences. Type I turns favour Asp, Asn, Ser and Cys at i; Asp, Ser, Thr and Pro at i + 1; Asp, Ser, Asn and Arg at i + 2; Gly, Trp and Met at i + 3, whilst type II turns prefer Pro at i + 1; Gly and Asn at i + 2; Gln and Arg at i + 3. These preferences have been explained by the specific side-chain interactions observed within the X-ray structures. The positional trends for type I and II beta-turns have been incorporated into the simple empirical predictive algorithm originally developed by P.N. Lewis et al. The program has improved the positional prediction of beta-turns, and has enhanced and extended the method by predicting the type of beta-turn. Since the observed preferences reflect local interactions these predictions are applicable not only to proteins, but also to peptides, many of which are thought to contain beta-turns.",

abstract="Experimental evidence and theoretical models both suggest that protein folding begins by specific short regions of the polypeptide chain intermittently assuming conformations close to their final ones. The independent folding properties and small size of these folding initiation sites make them suitable subjects for computational methods aimed at deriving structure from sequence. We have used a torsion space Monte Carlo procedure together with an all-atom free energy function to investigate the folding of a set of such sites. The free energy function is derived by a potential of mean force analysis of experimental protein structures. The most important contributions to the total free energy are the local main chain electrostatics, main chain hydrogen bonds, and the burial of nonpolar area. Six proposed independent folding units and four control peptides 11-14 residues long have been investigated. Thirty Monte Carlo simulations were performed on each peptide, starting from different random conformations. Five of the six folding units adopted conformations close to the experimental ones in some of the runs. None of the controls did so, as expected. The generated conformations which are close to the experimental ones have among the lowest free energies encountered, although some less native like low free energy conformations were also found. The effectiveness of the method on these peptides, which have a wide variety of experimental conformations, is encouraging in two ways: First, it provides independent evidence that these regions of the sequences are able to adopt native like conformations early in folding, and therefore are most probably key components of the folding pathways. Second, it demonstrates that available simulation methods and free energy functions are able to produce reasonably accurate structures. Extensions of the methods to the folding of larger portions of proteins are suggested.",

abstract="The nucleation event in $\alpha$-helix formation is a fundamental process in protein folding. However, determining how quickly it takes place based on measurements of the relaxation dynamics of helical peptides is difficult because such relaxations invariably contain contributions from various structural transitions such as from helical to nonhelical states and helical to partial-helical conformations. Herein, we measure the temperature-jump (T-jump) relaxation kinetics of three model peptides that fold into a single-turn $\alpha$-helix, using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, aiming to provide a direct assessment of the helix nucleation rate. The $\alpha$-helical structure of these peptides is stabilized by a covalent cross-linker formed between the side chains of two residues at the i and i + 4 positions. If we assume that this cross-linker mimics the structural constraint arising from a strong side chain-side chain interaction (e.g., a salt bridge) in proteins, these peptides would represent good models for studying the nucleation process of an $\alpha$-helix in a protein environment. Indeed, we find that the T-jump induced relaxation rate of these peptides is approximately (0.6 $\mu$s)(-1) at room temperature, which is slower than that of commonly studied alanine-based helical peptides but faster than that of a naturally occurring $\alpha$-helix whose folded state is stabilized by a series of side chain-side chain interactions. Taken together, our results put an upper limit of about 1 $\mu$s for the helix nucleation time at 20 {\textdegree}C and suggest that the subsequent propagation steps occur with a time constant of about 240 ns.",

abstract="Predicting accurate fragments from sequence has recently become a critical step for protein structure modeling, as protein fragment assembly techniques are presently among the most efficient approaches for de novo prediction. A key step in these approaches is, given the sequence of a protein to model, the identification of relevant fragments - candidate fragments - from a collection of the available 3D structures. These fragments can then be assembled to produce a model of the complete structure of the protein of interest. The search for candidate fragments is classically achieved by considering local sequence similarity using profile comparison, or threading approaches. In the present study, we introduce a new profile comparison approach that, instead of using amino acid profiles, is based on the use of predicted structural alphabet profiles, where structural alphabet profiles contain information related to the 3D local shapes associated with the sequences. We show that structural alphabet profile-profile comparison can be used efficiently to retrieve accurate structural fragments, and we introduce a fully new protocol for the detection of candidate fragments. It identifies fragments specific of each position of the sequence and of size varying between 6 and 27 amino-acids. We find it outperforms present state of the art approaches in terms (i) of the accuracy of the fragments identified, (ii) the rate of true positives identified, while having a high coverage score. We illustrate the relevance of the approach on complete target sets of the two previous Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) rounds 9 and 10.

Simulations begin from a realistic unfolded state devoid of secondary structure and use a chain representation lacking explicit side chains, rendering the simulations many orders of magnitude faster than molecular dynamics simulations. The multiple round nature of the algorithm mimics the authentic folding process and tests the effectiveness of sequential stabilization (SS) as a search strategy wherein 2{\textdegree} structural elements add onto existing structures in a process of progressive learning and stabilization of structure found in prior rounds of folding. Because no a priori knowledge is used, we can identify kinetically significant non-native interactions and intermediates, sometimes generated by only two mutations, while the evolution of contact matrices is often consistent with experiments. Moreover, structure prediction improves substantially by incorporating information from prior rounds. The success of our simple, homology-free approach affirms the validity of our description of the primary determinants of folding pathways and structure, and the effectiveness of SS as a search strategy.",

abstract="To clarify the physical basis of DNA binding specificity, the thermodynamic properties and DNA binding and bending abilities of the DNA binding domains (DBDs) of sequence-specific (SS) and non-sequence-specific (NSS) HMG box proteins were studied with various DNA recognition sequences using micro-calorimetric and optical methods. Temperature-induced unfolding of the free DBDs showed that their structure does not represent a single cooperative unit but is subdivided into two (in the case of NSS DBDs) or three (in the case of SS DBDs) sub-domains, which differ in stability. Both types of HMG box, most particularly SS, are partially unfolded even at room temperature but association with DNA results in stabilization and cooperation of all the sub-domains. Binding and bending measurements using fluorescence spectroscopy over a range of ionic strengths, combined with calorimetric data, allowed separation of the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the Gibbs energies of DNA binding, yielding their enthalpic and entropic terms and an estimate of their contributions to DNA binding and bending. In all cases electrostatic interactions dominate non-electrostatic in the association of a DBD with DNA. The main difference between SS and NSS complexes is that SS are formed with an enthalpy close to zero and a negative heat capacity effect, while NSS are formed with a very positive enthalpy and a positive heat capacity effect. This indicates that formation of SS HMG box-DNA complexes is specified by extensive van der Waals contacts between apolar groups, i.e. a more tightly packed interface forms than in NSS complexes. The other principal difference is that DNA bending by the NSS DBDs is driven almost entirely by the electrostatic component of the binding energy, while DNA bending by SS DBDs is driven mainly by the non-electrostatic component. The basic extensions of both categories of HMG box play a similar role in DNA binding and bending, making solely electrostatic interactions with the DNA.",

A standard information entropy for a primary sequence has been defined using the values of the probabilities of the most likely dihedral angles along the sequence. The distribution of entropy differences relative to the standard for each protein in a reference set--a sublibrary of the Protein Data Bank at the 90\% sequence redundancy level--appears to be nearly Gaussian. It gives rise to an auxiliary checking function whose value signals the extent to which the dihedral angle propensities differ from typical structures. Such deviations can arise either because of incorrect dihedral angle assignments or secondary structural propensities that are atypical of the structures in the reference set. This auxiliary checking function can be readily calculated at the public website, (http://www.d2check.gatech.edu). Its utility is demonstrated here in an analysis displaying differences between experimentally and theoretically derived structures, and in the analysis of structures derived by homology modeling.

The possible occurrence of 5 --> 1 C--H...O hydrogen bond between the ith residue CH group and (i - 4)th residue C==O with C...O 1 C--H...O hydrogen bonds, since the C--H...O hydrogen bonds found in helices are predominantly of type 5 --> 1 or 4 --> 1. A total of 17,367 (9310 of type 5 --> 1 and 8057 of type 4 --> 1) C--H...O hydrogen bonds are found to satisfy the selected criteria. The average stereochemical parameters for the data set suggest that the observed C--H...O hydrogen bonds are attractive interactions. Our analysis reveals that the Cgamma and Cbeta hydrogen atom(s) are frequently involved in such hydrogen bonds. A marked preference is noticed for aliphatic beta-branched residue Ile to participate in 5 --> 1 C--H...O hydrogen bonds involving methylene Cgamma 1 atom as donor in alpha-helices. This may be an enthalpic compensation for the greater loss of side-chain conformational entropy for beta-branched amino acids due to the constraint on side-chain torsion angle, namely, chi1, when they occur in helices. The preference of amino acids for 4 --> 1 C--H...O hydrogen bonds is found to be more for Asp, Cys, and for aromatic residues Trp, Phe, and His. Interestingly, overall propensity for C--H...O hydrogen bonds shows that a majority of the helix favoring residues such as Met, Glu, Arg, Lys, Leu, and Gln, which also have large side-chains, prefer to be involved in such types of weak attractive interactions in helices. The amino acid side-chains that participate in C--H...O interactions are found to shield the acceptor carbonyl oxygen atom from the solvent. In addition, C--H...O hydrogen bonds are present along with helix stabilizing salt bridges. A novel helix terminating interaction motif, X-Gly with Gly at C(cap) position having 5 --> 1 Calpha--H...O, and a chain reversal structural motif having 1 --> 5 Calpha-H...O have been identified and discussed. Our analysis highlights that a multitude of local C--H...O hydrogen bonds formed by a variety of amino acid side-chains and Calpha hydrogen atoms occur in helices and more so at the helix termini. It may be surmised that the main-chain Calpha and the side-chain CH that participate in C--H...O hydrogen bonds collectively augment the cohesive energy and thereby contribute together with the classical N--H...O hydrogen bonds and other interactions to the overall stability of helix and therefore of proteins.",

abstract="It was recently found that some short peptides (including C- and S-peptide fragments of RNase A) can have considerable helicity in solution, which was considered to be surprising. Does the observed helicity require a new explanation, or is it consistent with previous understanding? In this work we show that this helicity is consistent with the physical theory of secondary structure based on an extension of the conventional Zimm-Bragg model. Without any special modifications, this theory explains reasonably well almost all the experimentally observed dependencies of helicity on pH, temperature, and amino acid replacements. We conclude that the observed ``general level'' of helicity of C- and S-peptides (5-30\% at room temperature and 10-50\% near 0 degrees C) is ``normal'' for short peptides consisting mainly of helix-forming and helix-indifferent residues. The helicity is modified by a multitude of weak specific side chain interactions, many of which are taken into account by the present theory; some discrepancies between the theory and experiment can be explained by weak side-chain-side chain interactions that were neglected. A reasonable coincidence of the theory with experiment suggests that it had been used to investigate the role of local interactions in the formation of alpha-helical ``embryos'' in unfolded protein chains.",

We have examined packing solutions for alpha-helices by performing a crystal survey of the underlying backbone-backbone inter-geometry of tertiary contacts. The information content is different from, and complementary to, the results of side-chain to side-chain crystal surveys and studies of helix-helix-crossing angles. Six geometry descriptors were recorded from each tertiary contact in nonredundant data sets of globular and transmembrane proteins. The descriptors included distances, angles, and dihedral angles that together describe completely the underlying geometry of each contact. From the results it is possible to identify differences in the geometry requirements of tertiary contacts between alpha-helices in general and transmembrane alpha-helices. The differences become more apparent when the correlation between the different geometry descriptors is analyzed. The results are compared with those of other types of secondary structure. Finally, an investigation of how the geometry of tertiary contacts changes with the amino-acid types involved in the contact is performed using multivariate techniques. The results of this study provide a well-defined overview of the underlying structural framework of tertiary contacts between alpha-helices, in both globular and TM environments, that will have valuable implications for predicting protein tertiary structure.",

abstract="Understanding the sequence-structure relationships in globular proteins is important for reliable protein structure prediction and de novo design. Using a database of 1131 alpha-helices with nonidentical sequences from 205 nonhomologous globular protein chains, we have analyzed structural and sequence characteristics of alpha-helices. We find that geometries of more than 99\% of all the alpha-helices can be simply characterised as being linear, curved, or kinked. Only a small number of alpha-helices ( approximately 4\%) show sharp localized bends in their middle regions, and thus are classified as kinked. Approximately three-fourths (approximately 73\%) of the alpha-helices in globular proteins show varying degrees of smooth curvature, with a mean radius of curvature of 65 +/- 33 A; longer helices are less curved. Computation of helix accessibility to the solvent indicates that nearly two-thirds of the helices ( approximately 66\%) are largely buried in the protein core, and the length and geometry of the helices are not correlated with their location in the protein globule. However, the amino acid compositions and propensities of individual amino acids to occur in alpha-helices vary with their location in the protein globule, their geometries, and their lengths. In particular, Gln, Glu, Lys, and Arg are found more often in helices near the surface of globular proteins. Interestingly, kinks often seem to occur in regions where amino acids with low helix propensities (e.g., beta-branched and aromatic residues) cluster together, in addition to those associated with the occurrence of proline residues. Hence the propensities of individual amino acids to occur in a given secondary structure depend not only on conformation but also on its length, geometry, and location in the protein globule.",

abstract="Structural transitions are important for the stability and function of proteins, but these phenomena are poorly understood. An extensive analysis of Protein Data Bank entries reveals 103 regions in proteins with a tendency to transform from helical to nonhelical conformation and vice versa. We find that these dynamic helices, unlike other helices, are depleted in hydrophobic residues. Furthermore, the dynamic helices have higher surface accessibility and conformational mobility (P-value = 3.35e-07) than the rigid helices. Contact analyses show that these transitions result from protein-ligand, protein-nucleic acid, and crystal-contacts. The immediate structural environment differs quantitatively (P-value = 0.003) as well as qualitatively in the two alternate conformations. Often, dynamic helix experiences more contacts in its helical conformation than in the nonhelical counterpart (P-value = 0.001). There is differential preference for the type of short contacts observed in two conformational states. We also demonstrate that the regions in protein that can undergo such large conformational transitions can be predicted with a reasonable accuracy using logistic regression model of supervised learning. Our findings have implications in understanding the molecular basis of structural transitions that are coupled with binding and are important for the function and stability of the protein. Based on our observations, we propose that several functionally relevant regions on the protein surface can switch over their conformation from coil to helix and vice-versa, to regulate the recognition and binding of their partner and hence these may work as ``molecular switches'' in the proteins to regulate certain biological process. Our results supports the idea that protein structure-function paradigm should transform from static to a highly dynamic one.",

Using this coarse-grained mapping, protein conformation can be approximated by a linear sequence of mesostates. These linear strings can then be aligned and assessed by conventional sequence-comparison methods. We report that the mesostate sequence is sufficient to recognize a protein's family, superfamily, and fold with good fidelity.",

Via an iterative, top-down dissecting procedure, tertiary structures are spliced down to reveal their anatomy: first, to produce domains (defined by visual three-dimensional inspection criteria); then, hydrophobic folding units (HFU); and, at the end of a multilevel process, a set of building blocks. The resulting anatomy tree organization not only clearly depicts the organization of a one-dimensional polypeptide chain in three-dimensional space but also straightforwardly describes the most likely folding pathway(s). Comparison of the tree with the formation of the hydrophobic folding units through combinatorial assembly of the building blocks illustrates how the chain folds in a sequential or a complex folding pathway. Further, the tree points to the kinetics of the folding, whether the chain is a fast or a slow folder, and the probability of misfolding. Our ability to successfully dissect the protein into an anatomy tree illustrates that protein folding is a hierarchical process and further validates a building blocks protein folding model.",

abstract="The pathways by which proteins fold into their specific native structure are still an unsolved mystery. Currently, many methods for protein structure prediction are available, and most of them tackle the problem by relying on the vast amounts of data collected from known protein structures. These methods are often not concerned with the route the protein follows to reach its final fold. This work is based on the premise that proteins fold in a hierarchical manner. We present FOBIA, an automated method for predicting a protein structure. FOBIA consists of two main stages: the first finds matches between parts of the target sequence and independently folding structural units using profile-profile comparison. The second assembles these units into a 3D structure by searching and ranking their possible orientations toward each other using a docking-based approach. We have previously reported an application of an initial version of this strategy to homology based targets. Since then we have considerably enhanced our method's abilities to allow it to address the more difficult template-based target category. This allows us to now apply FOBIA to the template-based targets of CASP8 and to show that it is both very efficient and promising. Our method can provide an alternative for template-based structure prediction, and in particular, the docking-basedranking technique presented here can be incorporated into any profile-profile comparison based method.",

abstract="How a one-dimensional protein sequence folds into a specific 3D structure remains a difficult challenge in structural biology. Many computational methods have been developed in an attempt to predict the tertiary structure of the protein; most of these employ approaches that are based on the accumulated knowledge of solved protein structures. Here we introduce a novel and fully automated approach for predicting the 3D structure of a protein that is based on the well accepted notion that protein folding is a hierarchical process. Our algorithm follows the hierarchical model by employing two stages: the first aims to find a match between the sequences of short independently-folding structural entities and parts of the target sequence and assigns the respective structures. The second assembles these local structural parts into a complete 3D structure, allowing for long-range interactions between them. We present the results of applying our method to a subset of the targets from CASP6 and CASP7. Our results indicate that for targets with a significant sequence similarity to known structures we are often able to provide predictions that are better than those achieved by two leading servers, and that the most significant improvements in comparison with these methods occur in regions of a gapped structural alignment between the native structure and the closest available structural template. We conclude that in addition to performing well for targets with known homologous structures, our method shows great promise for addressing the more general category of comparative modeling targets, which is our next goal.",

abstract="Protein sequences can be represented as binary patterns of polar ([symbol: see text]) and nonpolar ([symbol: see text]) amino acids. These binary sequence patterns are categorized into two classes: Class A patterns match the structural repeat of an idealized amphiphilic alpha-helix (3.6 residues per turn), and class B patterns match the structural repeat of an idealized amphiphilic beta-strand (2 residues per turn). The difference between these two classes of sequence patterns has led to a strategy for de novo protein design based on binary patterning of polar and nonpolar amino acids. Here we ask whether similar binary patterning is incorporated in the sequences and structures of natural proteins. Analysis of the Protein Data Bank demonstrates the following. (1) Class A sequence patterns occur considerably more frequently in the sequences of natural proteins that would be expected at random, but class B patterns occur less often than expected. (2) Each pattern is found predominantly in the secondary structure expected from the binary strategy for protein design. Thus, class A patterns are found more frequently in alpha-helices than in beta-strands, and class B patterns are found more frequently in beta-strands than in alpha-helices. (3) Among the alpha-helices of natural proteins, the most commonly used binary patterns are indeed the class A patterns. (4) Among all beta-strands in the database, the most commonly used binary patterns are not the expected class B patterns. (5) However, for solvent-exposed beta-strands, the correlation is striking: All beta-strands in the database that contain the class B patterns are exposed to solvent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

abstract="The tendency of a polypeptide chain to form alpha-helical or beta-strand secondary structure depends upon local and nonlocal effects. Local effects reflect the intrinsic propensities of the amino acid residues for particular secondary structures, while nonlocal effects reflect the positioning of the individual residues in the context of the entire amino acid sequence. In particular, the periodicity of polar and nonpolar residues specifies whether a given sequence is consistent with amphiphilic alpha-helices or beta-strands. The importance of intrinsic propensities was compared to that of polar/nonpolar periodicity by a direct competition. Synthetic peptides were designed using residues with intrinsic propensities that favored one or the other type of secondary structure. The polar/nonpolar periodicities of the peptides were designed either to be consistent with the secondary structure favored by the intrinsic propensities of the component residues or in other cases to oppose these intrinsic propensities. Characterization of the synthetic peptides demonstrated that in all cases the observed secondary structure correlates with the periodicity of the peptide sequence--even when this secondary structure differs from that predicted from the intrinsic propensities of the component amino acids. The observed secondary structures are concentration dependent, indicating that oligomerization of the amphiphilic peptides is responsible for the observed secondary structures. Thus, for self-assembling oligomeric peptides, the polar/nonpolar periodicity can overwhelm the intrinsic propensities of the amino acid residues and serves as the major determinant of peptide secondary structure.",

abstract="This paper considers a phenomenon in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) analogous to drift in population genetic dynamics. Finite population sampling in selection results in fluctuations which get reinforced when the probability model is updated. As a consequence, any probability model which can generate only a single set of values with probability 1 can be an attractive fixed point of the algorithm. To avoid this, parameters of the algorithm must scale with the system size in strongly problem-dependent ways, or the algorithm must be modified. This phenomenon is shown to hold for general EDAs as a consequence of the lack of ergodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain on the state of probability models. It is illustrated in the case of UMDA, in which it is shown that the global optimum is only found if the population size is sufficiently large. For the needle-in-a haystack problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the size of the search space. For the one-max problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the problem size.",
