abstract = {The tendency of a polypeptide chain to form alpha-helical or beta-strand secondary structure depends upon local and nonlocal effects. Local effects reflect the intrinsic propensities of the amino acid residues for particular secondary structures, while nonlocal effects reflect the positioning of the individual residues in the context of the entire amino acid sequence. In particular, the periodicity of polar and nonpolar residues specifies whether a given sequence is consistent with amphiphilic alpha-helices or beta-strands. The importance of intrinsic propensities was compared to that of polar/nonpolar periodicity by a direct competition. Synthetic peptides were designed using residues with intrinsic propensities that favored one or the other type of secondary structure. The polar/nonpolar periodicities of the peptides were designed either to be consistent with the secondary structure favored by the intrinsic propensities of the component residues or in other cases to oppose these intrinsic propensities. Characterization of the synthetic peptides demonstrated that in all cases the observed secondary structure correlates with the periodicity of the peptide sequence--even when this secondary structure differs from that predicted from the intrinsic propensities of the component amino acids. The observed secondary structures are concentration dependent, indicating that oligomerization of the amphiphilic peptides is responsible for the observed secondary structures. Thus, for self-assembling oligomeric peptides, the polar/nonpolar periodicity can overwhelm the intrinsic propensities of the amino acid residues and serves as the major determinant of peptide secondary structure.},

abstract = {The Zimm-Bragg parameterssand $\sigma$ are calculated for the helix-coil transition of poly-l-alanine. The theoretical approach involves evaluating gas phase conformational energies for both coil and helical states using the CHARMM potential function and accounting for solvation effects with various continuum solvation models. Conformational free energies are then incorporated into a formalism developed by Goet al.for the calculation of s and $\sigma$. Calculated values for both s and $\sigma$ as well as the enthalpy change associated with helix formation are in good agreement with experimental data when the Finite Difference Poisson-Boltzmann (FDPB) method is used to treat solvent effects. The driving force for the helix-coil transition is analyzed in terms of individual free energy components. Hydrogen bond formation is found to contribute little to helix stability because the internal hydrogen bonding energy is largely canceled by the large free energy cost associated with removing polar groups from water. The entropic cost associated with fixing backbone dihedral angles in the helical conformation is found to be ∼7 e.u./residue (about 2 kcal/mol at room temperature). The major driving force favoring helix formation can be associated with interactions including enhanced van der Waals interactions in the close-packed helix conformation and the hydrophobic effect. These contribute about 2 kcal/mol favoring the helical state. The differences in helical propensities between alanine and glycine are attributed primarily to hydrophobic and packing interactions involving the C$\beta$with a smaller contribution arising from increased conformational freedom for glycine in the coil state. The description of helix formation presented here is consistent with previous conclusions regarding tertiary structure formation which suggest that hydrophobic and close-packed interactions provide stability while hydrogen bond formation constitutes a structural constraint imposed by the high free energy cost associated with burying unsatisfied hydrogen bonding groups. $\alpha$-Helix formation may thus be viewed as a form of hydrophobic collapse constrained by the requirement that polar groups be either exposed to solvent or form hydrogen bonds. More generally it appears from this study that for a folding model to be a realistic, it must properly account for the chemical nature of the polypeptide chain, particularly the solvation energetics of amide groups.},

abstract = {The factors that determine the stability of antiparallel $\beta$-sheets are consideredviaa theoretical analysis of conformational free energies. A series of idealized model polyalanine $\beta$-sheets are built with constraints such that the angular geometry of hydrogen bonding varies in the range observed in proteins while hydrogen bonding distance remains fixed. The conformations of the sheets generated in this way have a broad distribution of twist angles ranging from highly twisted left-handed to highly twisted right-handed orientations. The association free energies of the sheets are calculated with a gas phase CHARMM potential and FDPB/$\gamma$ solvation models. Left-handed structures are found to be less stable than right handed structures due to intrachain steric hindrance in isolated left-handed strands. This explains why antiparallel $\beta$-sheets in proteins are invariably twisted in the right-handed direction. The free energy surface for right-handed sheets shows particular preference for conformations ranging from flat to those that exhibit a pronounced right-handed twist. This suggests that antiparallel $\beta$-sheets can adopt a variety of right-handed conformations, a result that is consistent with observations on known proteins. In parallel with our study of $\alpha$-helices we find that van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions are the primary factor stabilizing polyalanine $\beta$-sheets, while electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding are found to be destabilizing. However, in contrast to helices, the net change in conformational free energy involving only backbone-backbone interactions (including $\beta$-carbons) is not sufficient to overcome the loss in configurational entropy that accompanies sheet formation. Rather we suggest that cross-strand non-polar side-chain–side-chain interactions are essential for sheet formation, explaining why large non-polar amino acids have the greatest sheet forming propensities. Thus, sheet propensities involve pairwise interactions and are expected to be context dependent, as has been observed in recent experiments.},

@article{Zotenko2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Recently a new class of methods for fast protein structure comparison has emerged. We call the methods in this class projection methods as they rely on a mapping of protein structure into a high-dimensional vector space. Once the mapping is done, the structure comparison is reduced to distance computation between corresponding vectors. As structural similarity is approximated by distance between projections, the success of any projection method depends on how well its mapping function is able to capture the salient features of protein structure. There is no agreement on what constitutes a good projection technique and the three currently known projection methods utilize very different approaches to the mapping construction, both in terms of what structural elements are included and how this information is integrated to produce a vector representation. RESULTS In this paper we propose a novel projection method that uses secondary structure information to produce the mapping. First, a diverse set of spatial arrangements of triplets of secondary structure elements, a set of structural models, is automatically selected. Then, each protein structure is mapped into a high-dimensional vector of "counts" or footprint, where each count corresponds to the number of times a given structural model is observed in the structure, weighted by the precision with which the model is reproduced. We perform the first comprehensive evaluation of our method together with all other currently known projection methods. CONCLUSION The results of our evaluation suggest that the type of structural information used by a projection method affects the ability of the method to detect structural similarity. In particular, our method that uses the spatial conformations of triplets of secondary structure elements outperforms other methods in most of the tests.},

It outperforms other servers, especially for proteins without close homologs in PDB or with very sparse sequence profile (i.e. carries little evolutionary information). This server employs a powerful in-house deep learning model DeepCNF (Deep Convolutional Neural Fields) to predict secondary structure (SS), solvent accessibility (ACC) and disorder regions (DISO). DeepCNF not only models complex sequence-structure relationship by a deep hierarchical architecture, but also interdependency between adjacent property labels. Our experimental results show that, tested on CASP10, CASP11 and the other benchmarks, this server can obtain ∼84{\%} Q3 accuracy for 3-state SS, ∼72{\%} Q8 accuracy for 8-state SS, ∼66{\%} Q3 accuracy for 3-state solvent accessibility, and ∼0.89 area under the ROC curve (AUC) for disorder prediction.},

abstract = {beta-Turns have been extracted from 59 non-identical proteins (resolution 2 A) using the standard criterion that the distance between C alpha (i) and C alpha (i + 3) is less than 7 A (1 A = 0.1 nm). The beta-turns have been classified, using phi, psi angles, into seven conventional turn types (I, I', II, II', IV, VIa, VIb) and a new class of beta-turn, designated type VIII, in which the central residues (i + 1, i + 2) adopt an alpha R beta conformation. Most beta-turn types are found in various topological environments, with the exception of I' and II' beta-turns, where 83{\%} and 50{\%}, respectively, are found in beta-hairpins. Sufficient data have been gathered to enable, for the first time, the separate statistical analysis of type I and II beta-turns. The two turn types have been shown to be strikingly different in their sequence preferences. Type I turns favour Asp, Asn, Ser and Cys at i; Asp, Ser, Thr and Pro at i + 1; Asp, Ser, Asn and Arg at i + 2; Gly, Trp and Met at i + 3, whilst type II turns prefer Pro at i + 1; Gly and Asn at i + 2; Gln and Arg at i + 3. These preferences have been explained by the specific side-chain interactions observed within the X-ray structures. The positional trends for type I and II beta-turns have been incorporated into the simple empirical predictive algorithm originally developed by P.N. Lewis et al. The program has improved the positional prediction of beta-turns, and has enhanced and extended the method by predicting the type of beta-turn. Since the observed preferences reflect local interactions these predictions are applicable not only to proteins, but also to peptides, many of which are thought to contain beta-turns.},

abstract = {Protein chains coil into alpha-helices and beta-sheet structures. Knowing the timescales and mechanism of formation of these basic structural elements is essential for understanding how proteins fold. For the past 40 years, alpha-helix formation has been extensively investigated in synthetic and natural peptides, including by nanosecond kinetic studies. In contrast, the mechanism of formation of beta structures has not been studied experimentally. The minimal beta-structure element is the beta-hairpin, which is also the basic component of antiparallel beta-sheets. Here we use a nanosecond laser temperature-jump apparatus to study the kinetics of folding a beta-hairpin consisting of 16 amino-acid residues. Folding of the hairpin occurs in 6 micros at room temperature, which is about 30 times slower than the rate of alpha-helix formation. We have developed a simple statistical mechanical model that provides a structural explanation for this result. Our analysis also shows that folding of a beta-hairpin captures much of the basic physics of protein folding, including stabilization by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, two-state behaviour, and a funnel-like, partially rugged energy landscape.},

@article{Wilmot1990a,
abstract = {Using the new version of a Protein Structural Database, BIPED, beta-turns have been extracted from 58 non-identical proteins (resolution less than or equal to 2 A) using the standard criteria that the distance between C alpha i and C alpha i + 3 is less than 7 A and that the central residues are not helical. It has been shown that 42{\%} of these do not fit into the eight conventional turn types (I, I', II, II', VIa, VIb and VIII) as defined by phi, psi limits for residues i + 1 and i + 2. Most of the unclassified turns are 'distortions' of the standard turn types, lying just outside the specified limits. Eleven per cent of the turns are not related to the standard types, and have completely different phi, psi combinations. Therefore, the conformational space available to a trans tetrapeptide has been explored to find all two-residue phi, psi combinations which satisfy the criteria for beta-turn formation. The conformations generated by the search are the conformations observed in the data. On the basis of these observations a new nomenclature is suggested for beta-turns based on a shorthand descriptor of populated regions of the phi, psi plot. For example, it is proposed that a type I turn should now be described as an alpha alpha turn, the descriptor indicating the phi, psi regions of the i + 1 and i + 2 positions of the turn. The use of descriptors, which convey information about the turn type conformation, should aid protein structural workers in turn classification and visualization. The sequence preferences for the alpha beta turn have been elucidated: Pro, Asp and Ser at i + 1; Asn and His at i + 2; Pro at i + 3. These preferences have been explained in terms of specific interactions involving the side-chains. The beta-turn prediction program, BTURN 1.0, has been further developed by alterations to the calculation of parameters, the removal of incompatible multiple turn predictions and the inclusion of the distorted types alpha alpha and beta p gamma data in the respective sets of parameters, to yield BTURN 2.0. A variation of this beta-turn prediction program, called GORBTURN 1.0, has been developed, which uses the directional parameters produced from work by Garrett et al., to eliminate potential helix and strand-forming residues from the beta-turn prediction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Computational methods are rapidly gaining importance in the field of structural biology, mostly due to the explosive progress in genome sequencing projects and the large disparity between the number of sequences and the number of structures. There has been an exponential growth in the number of available protein sequences and a slower growth in the number of structures. There is therefore an urgent need to develop computational methods to predict structures and identify their functions from the sequence. Developing methods that will satisfy these needs both efficiently and accurately is of paramount importance for advances in many biomedical fields, including drug development and discovery of biomarkers. A novel method called fast learning optimized prediction methodology (FLOPRED) is proposed for predicting protein secondary structure, using knowledge-based potentials combined with structure information from the CATH database. A neural network-based extreme learning machine (ELM) and advanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) are used with this data that yield better and faster convergence to produce more accurate results. Protein secondary structures are predicted reliably, more efficiently and more accurately using FLOPRED. These techniques yield superior classification of secondary structure elements, with a training accuracy ranging between 83 {\%} and 87 {\%} over a widerange of hidden neurons and a cross-validated testing accuracy ranging between 81 {\%} and 84 {\%} and a segment overlap (SOV) score of 78 {\%} that are obtained with different sets of proteins. These results are comparable to other recently published studies, but are obtained with greater efficiencies, in terms of time and cost.},

abstract = {This paper considers a phenomenon in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA) analogous to drift in population genetic dynamics. Finite population sampling in selection results in fluctuations which get reinforced when the probability model is updated. As a consequence, any probability model which can generate only a single set of values with probability 1 can be an attractive fixed point of the algorithm. To avoid this, parameters of the algorithm must scale with the system size in strongly problem-dependent ways, or the algorithm must be modified. This phenomenon is shown to hold for general EDAs as a consequence of the lack of ergodicity and irreducibility of the Markov chain on the state of probability models. It is illustrated in the case of UMDA, in which it is shown that the global optimum is only found if the population size is sufficiently large. For the needle-in-a haystack problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the size of the search space. For the one-max problem, the population size must scale as the square-root of the problem size.},

abstract = {A physical theory of protein secondary structure is proposed and tested by performing exceedingly simple Monte Carlo simulations. In essence, secondary structure propensities are predominantly a consequence of two competing local effects, one favoring hydrogen bond formation in helices and turns, the other opposing the attendant reduction in sidechain conformational entropy on helix and turn formation. These sequence specific biases are densely dispersed throughout the unfolded polypeptide chain, where they serve to preorganize the folding process and largely, but imperfectly, anticipate the native secondary structure.},

@article{Stickle1992,
abstract = {A global census of the hydrogen bonds in 42 X-ray-elucidated proteins was taken and the following demographic trends identified: (1) Most hydrogen bonds are local, i.e. between partners that are close in sequence, the primary exception being hydrogen-bonded ion pairs. (2) Most hydrogen bonds are between backbone atoms in the protein, an average of 68{\%}. (3) All proteins studied have extensive hydrogen-bonded secondary structure, an average of 82{\%}. (4) Almost all backbone hydrogen bonds are within single elements of secondary structure. An approximate rule of thirds applies: slightly more than one-third (37{\%}) form i----i--3 hydrogen bonds, almost one-third (32{\%}) form i----i--4 hydrogen bonds, and slightly less than one-third (26{\%}) reside in paired strands of beta-sheet. The remaining 5{\%} are not wholly within an individual helix, turn or sheet. (5) Side-chain to backbone hydrogen bonds are clustered at helix-capping positions. (6) An extensive network of hydrogen bonds is present in helices. (7) To a close approximation, the total number of hydrogen bonds is a simple function of a protein's helix and sheet content. (8) A unique quantity, termed the reduced number of hydrogen bonds, is defined as the maximum number of hydrogen bonds possible when every donor:acceptor pair is constrained to be 1:1. This quantity scales linearly with chain length, with 0.71 reduced hydrogen bond per residue. Implications of these results for pathways of protein folding are discussed.},

To probe the role of this intermediate in the folding of RNase H, the folding kinetics of mutant proteins with altered native state stabilities were investigated. Mutations within the folding core destabilize the kinetic intermediate and slow refolding in a manner consistent with an obligatory intermediate model. Mutations outside of the folding core, however, do not affect the stability of the kinetic intermediate but do perturb the native state and transition state. These results indicate that interactions formed in the intermediate persist in the transition and native states and that RNase H folds through a hierarchical mechanism.},

The results confirm earlier observations, such as asymmetrical charge distributions in the first and last helical turn, but several new, sharp preferences are found as well. The most striking of these are a 3.5:1 preference for Asn at the N-cap position, and a preference of 2.6:1 for Pro at N-cap + 1. The C-cap position is overwhelmingly dominated by Gly, which ends 34 percent of the helices. Hydrophobic residues peak at positions N-cap + 4 and C-cap - 4.},

abstract = {EVA is a web-based server that evaluates automatic structure prediction servers continuously and objectively. Since June 2000, EVA collected more than 20,000 secondary structure predictions. The EVA sets sufficed to conclude that the field of secondary structure prediction has advanced again. Accuracy increased substantially in the 1990s through using evolutionary information taken from the divergence of proteins in the same structural family. Recently, the evolutionary information resulting from improved searches and larger databases has again boosted prediction accuracy by more than 4{\%} to its current height around 76{\%} of all residues predicted correctly in one of the three states: helix, strand, or other. The best current methods solved most of the problems raised at earlier CASP meetings: All good methods now get segments right and perform well on strands. Is the recent increase in accuracy significant enough to make predictions even more useful? We believe the answer is affirmative. What is the limit of prediction accuracy? We shall see. All data are available through the EVA web site at [cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/eva/]. The raw data for the results presented are available at [eva]/sec/bup{\_}common/2001{\_}02{\_}22/.},

abstract = {Side-chain to side-chain contacts, accessibility, secondary structure and RMS deviation were compared within 607 pairs of proteins having similar three-dimensional (3D) structures. Three types of protein 3D structural similarities were defined: type A having sequence and usually functional similarity; type B having functional, but no sequence similarity; and type C having only 3D structural similarity. Within proteins having little or no sequence similarity (types B and C), structural features frequently had a degree of conservation comparable to dissimilar 3D structures. Despite similar protein folds, as few as 30{\%} of residues within similar protein 3D structures can form a common core. RMS deviations on core C$\alpha$ atoms can be as high as 3.2 {\AA}. Similar protein structures can have secondary structure identities as low as 41{\%}, which is equivalent to that expected by chance. By defining three categories of amino acid accessibility (buried, half buried and exposed), some similar protein 3D structures have as few as 30{\%} of positions in the same category, making them indistinguishable from pairs of dissimilar protein structures. Similar structures can also have as few as 12{\%} of common side-chain to side-chain contacts, and virtually no similar energetically favourable side-chain to side-chain interactions. Complementary changes are defined as structurally equivalent pairs of interacting residues in two structures with energetically favourable but different side-chain interactions. For many proteins with similar three-dimensional structures, the proportion of complementary changes is near to that expected by chance, suggesting that many similar structures have fundamentally different stabilising interactions. All of the results suggest that proteins having similar 3D structures can have little in common apart from a scaffold of core secondary structures. This has profound implications for methods of protein fold detection, since many of the properties assumed to be conserved across similar protein 3D structures (e.g. accessibility, side-chain to side-chain contacts, etc.) are often unconserved within weakly similar (i.e. type B and C) protein 3D structures. Little difference was found between type B and C similarities suggesting that the structure of similar proteins can evolve beyond recognition even when function is conserved. Our findings suggest that it is more general features of protein structure, such as the requirements for burial of hydrophobic residues and exposure of polar residues, rather than specific residue-residue interactions that determine how well a particular sequence adopts a particular fold. If detection of similar folds having little in common outside of their core secondary structures is to become a reality, efforts should concentrate on such general principles, and on methods for modelling large loop regions that are likely to differ between similar 3D structures.},

The lineshape of a single histidine resonance was fit as a function of denaturant to give folding and unfolding rate constants. The B-domain folds extremely rapidly in a two-state manner, with a folding rate constant of 120,000 s-1, making it one of the fastest-folding proteins known. Diffusion-collision theory predicts folding and unfolding rate constants that are in good agreement with the experimental values. The apparent rate constant as a function of denaturant ('chevron plot') is predicted within an order of magnitude. Our results are consistent with a model whereby fast-folding proteins utilize a diffusion-collision mechanism, with the preorganization of one or more elements of secondary structure in the unfolded protein.},

abstract = {The ability to engineer novel proteins using the principles of molecular structure and energetics is a stringent test of our basic understanding of how proteins fold and maintain structure. The design of protein self-assembly has the potential to impact many fields of biology from molecular recognition to cell signaling to biomaterials. Most progress in computational design of protein self-assembly has focused on $\alpha$-helical systems, exploring ways to concurrently optimize the stability and specificity of a target state. Applying these methods to collagen self-assembly is very challenging, due to fundamental differences in folding and structure of $\alpha$- versus triple-helices. Here, we explore various computational methods for designing stable and specific oligomeric systems, with a focus on $\alpha$-helix and collagen self-assembly.},

@article{Petukhov1998a,
abstract = {Until now and based on the success of the helix/coil transition theory it has been assumed that the $\alpha$-helical propensities of the amino acids are position independent. This has been critical to derive the set of theoretical parameters for the 20 natural amino acids. Here, we have analyzed the behavior of several non-polar residues, Val, Ile, Leu, Met and Gly at the N-cap, at each position of the first helical turn and at a central helical position of a 16-residue peptide model system that starts with eight consecutive alanine residues. We have interpreted the results from these experiments with the model of the helix/coil transition (AGADIR), that indicates that the intrinsic helical propensity is position dependent. Gly, Val and Ile are more favorable at the first turn than in the middle of the $\alpha$-helix, while for Leu and Met we observe the opposite behavior. The differences between the observed helical propensities are as large as 1.0 kcal/mol in some cases. Molecular modeling calculations using the ECEPP/2 force-field equipped with a hydration potential show that this effect can be explained by the combination of three factors: (a) the side-chains in the first helix turn are more solvent-exposed; (b) they have fewer intramolecular van der Waals' contacts; and (c) they posses higher configurational entropy than that in the central position of an $\alpha$-helix. The position-dependent results of the calculations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimates and with the intrinsic propensities of the amino acids derived from the statistical analysis of the protein structure database.},

In the accompanying paper the information about the conformational behaviour of helical peptides in solution, as well as the studies on alpha-helix stability in proteins has been utilised to derive a database of energy interactions. This database, when implemented in an algorithm based on the helix-coil transition theory (AGADIR), correctly calculates the average helical behaviour in solution of 423 peptides analysed by circular dichroism. The majority of these peptides have been studied at low temperatures (0 to 10 degrees C), and neutral pH. However, in vivo, proteins fold at higher temperatures and in some cases low or high pH values. To understand protein folding it is necessary to calculate the helical behaviour of linear peptides under very different temperature and pH experimental conditions. We have included the temperature and pH effects on the helical behaviour of peptides by means of generally accepted assumptions and simplifications. The inclusion of these terms allow us to calculate the helical behaviour of polyalanine-based peptides, as well as of complex natural sequences, under different experimental conditions.},

The information about the conformational behaviour of helical peptides in solution, as well as the alpha-helix stability in proteins, has been utilised to derive a database with the energy contributions for various interaction taking place in an alpha-helix: intrinsic helical propensities, side-chain to side-chain interactions, main-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds, and capping effects. This database was implemented in a algorithm based on the helix-coil transition theory (AGADIR). Here, the effects on helix stability due to interactions between charged groups and the helix macrodipole are described, quantified and implemented in AGADIR. The algorithm correctly calculates the average helical behaviour in solution of 423 peptides analysed by circular dichroism and it describes the helicity at a residue level, as found when comparing the prediction for each amino acid residue with the data derived from nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Using AGADIR we have done a rational modification of peptides corresponding to protein secondary structure elements in order to increase their helical content. The circular dichroism analysis of the mutant peptides showed a very good agreement between the experimental and calculated helical content. Moreover, in certain specific cases in which strong tertiary contacts in folded proteins do not exist, the algorithm successfully predicts the length of mutagenised alpha-helices. It is interesting to note that the final values of the parameters used do not significantly differ in absolute terms from those extracted from mutagenesis studies in proteins. This indicates that the same physico-chemical principles stand for both systems.},

abstract = {Protein secondary structures have been viewed as fundamental building blocks for protein folding, structure and design. Previous studies indicate that the propensities of individual amino acids to form particular secondary structures are the result of a combination of local conformational preferences and non-local factors. To examine the extent to which non-local factors influence the formation of secondary structural elements, we have designed an 11-amino-acid sequence (dubbed the 'chameleon' sequence) that folds as an alpha-helix when in one position but as a beta-sheet when in another position of the primary sequence of the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). Both proteins, chameleon-alpha and chameleon-beta, are folded into structures similar to native GB1, as judged by several biophysical criteria. Our results demonstrate that non-local interactions can determine the secondary structure of peptide sequences of substantial length. They also support views of protein folding that favour tertiary interactions as dominant determinants of structure.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations can be used to reveal the detailed conformational behaviors of peptides and proteins. By comparing fragment and full-length protein simulations, we can investigate the role of each peptide segment in the folding process. Here, we take advantage of information regarding the helix formation process from our previous simulations of barnase and protein A as well as new simulations of four helical fragments from these proteins at three different temperatures, starting with both helical and extended structures. Segments with high helical propensity began the folding process by tethering the chain through side chain interactions involving either polar interactions, such as salt bridges, or hydrophobic staples. These tethers were frequently nonnative (i.e., not i --{\textgreater} i + 4 spacing) and provided a scaffold for other residues, thereby limiting the conformational search. The helical structure then propagated on both sides of the tether. Segments with low stability and propensity formed later in the folding process and utilized contacts with other portions of the protein when folding. These helices formed via a tertiary contact-assisted mechanism, primarily via hydrophobic contacts between residues distant in sequence. Thus, segments with different helical propensities appear to play different roles during protein folding. Furthermore, the active role of nonlocal side chains in helix formation highlights why we must move beyond simple hierarchical models of protein folding.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Macromolecular structures, such as neuraminidases, hemagglutinins, and monoclonal antibodies, are not rigid entities. Rather, they are characterised by their flexibility, which is the result of the interaction and collective motion of their constituent atoms. This conformational diversity has a significant impact on their physicochemical and biological properties. Among these are their structural stability, the transport of ions through the M2 channel, drug resistance, macromolecular docking, binding energy, and rational epitope design. To assess these properties and to calculate the associated thermodynamical observables, the conformational space must be efficiently sampled and the dynamic of the constituent atoms must be simulated. This paper presents algorithms and techniques that address the abovementioned issues. To this end, a computational review of molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, Langevin dynamics, and free energy calculation is presented. The exposition is made from first principles to promote a better understanding of the potentialities, limitations, applications, and interrelations of these computational methods.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The field of structural biology, whose aim is to elucidate the molecular and atomic structures of biological macromolecules, has long been at the forefront of biomedical sciences in adopting and developing computational research methods. Operating at the intersection between biophysics, biochemistry, and molecular biology, structural biology's growth into a foundational framework on which many concepts and findings of molecular biology are interpreted1 has depended largely on parallel advancements in computational tools and techniques. Without these computing advances, modern structural biology would likely have remained an exclusive pursuit practiced by few, and not become the widely practiced, foundational field it is today. As other areas of biomedical research increasingly embrace research computing techniques, the successes, failures and lessons of structural biology computing can serve as a useful guide to progress in other biomedically related research fields.},

abstract = {One of the most promising areas in which probabilistic graphical models have shown an incipient activity is the field of heuristic optimization and, in particular, in Estimation of Distribution Algorithms. Due to their inherent parallelism, different research lines have been studied trying to improve Estimation of Distribution Algorithms from the point of view of execution time and/or accuracy. Among these proposals, we focus on the so-called distributed or island-based models. This approach defines several islands (algorithms instances) running independently and exchanging information with a given frequency. The information sent by the islands can be either a set of individuals or a probabilistic model. This paper presents a comparative study for a distributed univariate Estimation of Distribution Algorithm and a multivariate version, paying special attention to the comparison of two alternative methods for exchanging information, over a wide set of parameters and problems – the standard benchmark developed for the IEEE Workshop on Evolutionary Algorithms and other Metaheuristics for Continuous Optimization Problems of the ISDA 2009 Conference. Several analyses from different points of view have been conducted to analyze both the influence of the parameters and the relationships between them including a characterization of the configurations according to their behavior on the proposed benchmark.},

abstract = {We present a method to identify all compact, contiguous-chain, structural units in a globular protein from x-ray coordinates. These units are then used to describe a complete set of hierarchic folding pathways for the molecule. Our analysis shows that the larger units are combinations of smaller units, giving rise to a structural hierarchy ranging from the whole protein monomer through supersecondary structures down to individual helices and strands. It turns out that there is more than one way to assemble the protein by self-association of its compact units. However, the number of possible pathways is small--small enough to be exhaustively explored by a computer program. The hierarchic organization of compact units in protein molecules is consistent with a model for folding by hierarchic condensation. In this model, neighboring hydrophobic chain sites interact to form folding clusters, with further stepwise cluster association giving rise to a population of folding intermediates.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interactions effectively mediate molecular function. They are the result of specific interactions between protein interfaces and are maintained by the action of evolutionary pressure on the regions of the interacting proteins that contribute to binding. For the most part, selection restricts amino acid replacements, accounting for the conservation of binding interfaces. However, in some cases, change in one protein will be mitigated by compensatory change in its binding partner, maintaining function in the face of evolutionary change. There have been several attempts to use correlations in sequence evolution to predict interactions of proteins. Most commonly, these approaches use the entire sequence to identify correlations and so infer probable binding. However, other factors such as shared evolutionary history and similarities in the rates of evolution confound these whole-sequence-based approaches. Here, we discuss recent work on this topic and argue that both site-specific coevolutionary change and whole-sequence evolution contribute to evolutionary signals in sets of interacting proteins. We discuss the relative effects of both types of selection and how they might be identified. This permits an integrated view of protein-protein interactions, their evolution, and coevolution.},

abstract = {We have investigated amino acid features that determine secondary structure: (1) the solvent accessibility of each side chain, and (2) the interaction of each side chain with others one to four residues apart. Solvent accessibility is a simple model that distinguishes residue environment. The pairwise interactions represent a simple model of local side chain to side chain interactions. To test the importance of these features we developed an algorithm to separate alpha-helices, beta-strands, and "other" structure. Single residue and pairwise probabilities were determined for 25,141 samples from proteins with {\textless}30{\%} homology. Combining the features of solvent accessibility with pairwise probabilities allows us to distinguish the three structures after cross validation at the 82.0{\%} level. We gain 1.4{\%} to 2.0{\%} accuracy by optimizing the propensities, demonstrating that probabilities do not necessarily reflect propensities. Optimization of residue exposures, weights of all probabilities, and propensities increased accuracy to 84.0{\%}.},

abstract = {Spectroscopic studies have identified a number of proteins that appear to retain significant residual structure under even strongly denaturing conditions. Intrinsic viscosity, hydrodynamic radii, and small-angle x-ray scattering studies, in contrast, indicate that the dimensions of most chemically denatured proteins scale with polypeptide length by means of the power-law relationship expected for random-coil behavior. Here we further explore this discrepancy by expanding the length range of characterized denatured-state radii of gyration (R(G)) and by reexamining proteins that reportedly do not fit the expected dimensional scaling. We find that only 2 of 28 crosslink-free, prosthetic-group-free, chemically denatured polypeptides deviate significantly from a power-law relationship with polymer length. The R(G) of the remaining 26 polypeptides, which range from 16 to 549 residues, are well fitted (r(2) = 0.988) by a power-law relationship with a best-fit exponent, 0.598 +/- 0.028, coinciding closely with the 0.588 predicted for an excluded volume random coil. Therefore, it appears that the mean dimensions of the large majority of chemically denatured proteins are effectively indistinguishable from the mean dimensions of a random-coil ensemble.},

@article{Martin2005a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND A number of methods are now available to perform automatic assignment of periodic secondary structures from atomic coordinates, based on different characteristics of the secondary structures. In general these methods exhibit a broad consensus as to the location of most helix and strand core segments in protein structures. However the termini of the segments are often ill-defined and it is difficult to decide unambiguously which residues at the edge of the segments have to be included. In addition, there is a "twilight zone" where secondary structure segments depart significantly from the idealized models of Pauling and Corey. For these segments, one has to decide whether the observed structural variations are merely distorsions or whether they constitute a break in the secondary structure. METHODS To address these problems, we have developed a method for secondary structure assignment, called KAKSI. Assignments made by KAKSI are compared with assignments given by DSSP, STRIDE, XTLSSTR, PSEA and SECSTR, as well as secondary structures found in PDB files, on 4 datasets (X-ray structures with different resolution range, NMR structures). RESULTS A detailed comparison of KAKSI assignments with those of STRIDE and PSEA reveals that KAKSI assigns slightly longer helices and strands than STRIDE in case of one-to-one correspondence between the segments. However, KAKSI tends also to favor the assignment of several short helices when STRIDE and PSEA assign longer, kinked, helices. Helices assigned by KAKSI have geometrical characteristics close to those described in the PDB. They are more linear than helices assigned by other methods. The same tendency to split long segments is observed for strands, although less systematically. We present a number of cases of secondary structure assignments that illustrate this behavior. CONCLUSION Our method provides valuable assignments which favor the regularity of secondary structure segments.},

abstract = {Protein crystals have catalytic and materials applications and are central to efforts in structural biology and therapeutic development. Designing predetermined crystal structures can be subtle given the complexity of proteins and the noncovalent interactions that govern crystallization. De novo protein design provides an approach to engineer highly complex nanoscale molecular structures, and often the positions of atoms can be programmed with sub-Å precision. Herein, a computational approach is presented for the design of proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals. A three-helix coiled-coil protein is designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which has a "honeycomb-like" structure and hexameric channels that span the crystal. The approach involves: (i) creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry; (ii) characterizing this ensemble to identify "designable" structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures; (iii) experimentally characterizing candidate proteins. A 2.1 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of one such designed protein exhibits sub-Å agreement [backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd)] with the computational model of the crystal. This approach to crystal design has potential applications to the de novo design of nanostructured materials and to the modification of natural proteins to facilitate X-ray crystallographic analysis.},

abstract = {The mechanism of protein folding has been the subject of extensive investigation during the last decade, both because of its academic challenge and because of its relation to many diseases which are known to occur due to misfolding of proteins. In this context, we report here a systematic investigation on the step-wise formation of a helical structure by the addition of hexafluoroacetone, in a 14-residue peptide derived from a part of the scorpion neurotoxin protein. The NMR and circular dichroism results indicate that the peptide has an inherent propensity for helix formation and this is limited to the internal few residues in aqueous solution. With the addition of the fluorosolvent, the helical content progressively increases and spans the whole sequence. This is accompanied by concomitant packing of the side chains. These results provide support to the so-called hierarchic model of protein folding which dictates that the local sequence determines the secondary structures in the protein and the side chains play an important role in this process.},

abstract = {Motivated by the relationship between the folding mechanism and the native structure, we develop a unified approach for predicting folding pathways and tertiary structure using only the primary sequence as input. Simulations begin from a realistic unfolded state devoid of secondary structure and use a chain representation lacking explicit side chains, rendering the simulations many orders of magnitude faster than molecular dynamics simulations. The multiple round nature of the algorithm mimics the authentic folding process and tests the effectiveness of sequential stabilization (SS) as a search strategy wherein 2° structural elements add onto existing structures in a process of progressive learning and stabilization of structure found in prior rounds of folding. Because no a priori knowledge is used, we can identify kinetically significant non-native interactions and intermediates, sometimes generated by only two mutations, while the evolution of contact matrices is often consistent with experiments. Moreover, structure prediction improves substantially by incorporating information from prior rounds. The success of our simple, homology-free approach affirms the validity of our description of the primary determinants of folding pathways and structure, and the effectiveness of SS as a search strategy.},

abstract = {The poly-l-proline type II (PPII) helix in recent years has emerged clearly as a structural class not only of fibrillar proteins (in collagen, PPII is a dominant conformation) but also of the folded and unfolded proteins. Although much less abundant in folded proteins than the ??-helix and ??-structure, the left-handed, extended PPII helix represents the only frequently occurring regular structure apart from these two structure classes. Natively unfolded proteins have a high content of the PPII helices identified by spectroscopic methods. Apart from the structural function, PPII is favorable for protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions and plays a major role in signal transduction and protein complex assembly, as this structure is often found in binding sites, specifically binding sites of widely spread SH3 domains. PPII helices do not necessarily contain proline, but proline has high PPII propensity. Commonly occurring proline-rich regions, serving as recognition sites, are likely to have PPII structure. PPII helices are involved in transcription, cell motility, self-assembly, elasticity, and bacterial and viral pathogenesis, and has an important structural role in amyloidogenic proteins. However, PPII helices are not always assigned in experimentally solved structures, and they are rarely used in protein structure modeling. We aim to give an overview of this structural class and of the place it holds in our current understanding of protein structure and function. This review is subdivided into three main parts: the first part covers PPII helices in unfolded peptides and proteins, the second part includes studies of the PPII helices in folded proteins, and the third part discusses the functional role of the PPII. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {To visualize a bird's-eye view of an ensemble of proteomes for various species, we recently developed a novel method of mapping a proteome ensemble into Three-Dimensional (3D) vector space. In this study, the " proteome" is defined as the entire set of all proteins encoded in a genome sequence, and these proteins were dealt with at the level of the SCOP Fold. First, we represented the proteome of a species s by a 1053-dimensional vector x(s), where its length {\{}divides{\}}. x(s){\{}divides{\}} represents the overall amount of all the SCOP Folds in the proteome, and its unit vector x(s)/{\{}divides{\}}. x(s){\{}divides{\}} represents the relative composition of the SCOP Folds in the proteome and the size of the dimension, 1053, is the number of all possible Folds in the proteome ensemble given. Second, we mapped the vector x(s) to the 3D vector y(s), based on the two simple principles: (1) {\{}divides{\}}. y(s){\{}divides{\}} = {\{}divides{\}}. x(s){\{}divides{\}}, and (2) the angle between y(s) and y(t) maximally correlates with the angle between x(s) and x(t). We applied to the mapping of a proteome ensemble for 456 species, which were retrieved from the Genomes TO Protein structures and functions (GTOP) database. As a result, we succeeded in the mapping in that the properties of the 1053-dimensional vectors were quantitatively conserved in the 3D vectors. Particularly, the angles between vectors before and after the mapping highly correlated with each other (correlation coefficients were 0.95-0.96). This new mapping method will allow researchers to intuitively interpret the visual information presented in the maps in a highly effective manner. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {There is currently a gap in knowledge between complexes of known three-dimensional structure and those known from other experimental methods such as affinity purifications or the two-hybrid system. This gap can sometimes be bridged by methods that extrapolate interaction information from one complex structure to homologues of the interacting proteins. To do this, it is important to know if and when proteins of the same type (e.g. family, superfamily or fold) interact in the same way. Here, we study interactions of known structure to address this question. We found all instances within the structural classification of proteins database of the same domain pairs interacting in different complexes, and then compared them with a simple measure (interaction RMSD). When plotted against sequence similarity we find that close homologues (30-40{\%} or higher sequence identity) almost invariably interact the same way. Conversely, similarity only in fold (i.e. without additional evidence for a common ancestor) is only rarely associated with a similarity in interaction. The results suggest that there is a twilight zone of sequence similarity where it is not possible to say whether or not domains will interact similarly. We also discuss the rare instances of fold similarities interacting the same way, and those where obviously homologous proteins interact differently. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Many experimental and computational studies aim to deepen our understanding of these interactions and improve our capacity to predict them. In this respect, the evolutionary perspective is most interesting, since the preservation of structure and function puts constraints on the evolution of proteins and their interactions. However, uncovering these constraints remains a challenge, and the description and detection of evolutionary signals in protein-protein interactions is currently a very active field of research. Here, we review recent works dissecting the mechanisms of protein-protein interaction evolution and exploring how to use evolutionary information to predict interactions, both at the global level of the interactome and at the detailed level of protein-protein interfaces. We first present to what extent protein-protein interactions are found to be conserved within interactomes and which properties can influence their conservation. We then discuss the evolutionary and co-evolutionary pressures applied on protein-protein interfaces. Finally, we describe how the computational prediction of interfaces can benefit from evolutionary inputs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The biological functions of DNA-binding proteins often require that they interact with their targets with high affinity and/or high specificity. Here, we describe a computational method that estimates the extent of optimization for affinity and specificity of amino acids at a protein-DNA interface based on the crystal structure of the complex, by modeling the changes in binding-free energy associated with all individual amino acid and base substitutions at the interface. The extent to which residues are predicted to be optimal for specificity versus affinity varies within a given protein-DNA interface and between different complexes, and in many cases recapitulates previous experimental observations. The approach provides a complement to traditional methods of mutational analysis, and should be useful for rapidly formulating hypotheses about the roles of amino acid residues in protein-DNA interfaces.},

abstract = {Capturing how the structures of interacting partners evolved at their binding interfaces is a fundamental issue for understanding interactomes evolution. In that scope, the InterEvol database was designed for exploring 3D structures of homologous interfaces of protein complexes. For every chain forming a complex in the protein data bank (PDB), close and remote structural interologs were identified providing essential snapshots for studying interfaces evolution. The database provides tools to retrieve and visualize these structures. In addition, pre-computed multiple sequence alignments of most likely interologs retrieved from a wide range of species can be downloaded to enrich the analysis. The database can be queried either directly by pdb code or keyword but also from the sequence of one or two partners. Interologs multiple sequence alignments can also be recomputed online with tailored parameters using the InterEvolAlign facility. Last, an InterEvol PyMol plugin was developed to improve interactive exploration of structures versus sequence alignments at the interfaces of complexes. Based on a series of automatic methods to extract structural and sequence data, the database will be monthly updated. Structures coordinates and sequence alignments can be queried and downloaded from the InterEvol web interface at http://biodev.cea.fr/interevol/.},

A repository of well-validated high-quality protein-protein interactions can be used in both large- and small-scale studies to generate and validate a wide range of functional hypotheses. RESULTS We develop HINT (http://hint.yulab.org) - a database of high-quality protein-protein interactomes for human, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and Oryza sativa. These were collected from several databases and filtered both systematically and manually to remove low-quality/erroneous interactions. The resulting datasets are classified by type (binary physical interactions vs. co-complex associations) and data source (high-throughput systematic setups vs. literature-curated small-scale experiments). We find strong sociological sampling biases in literature-curated datasets of small-scale interactions. An interactome without such sampling biases was used to understand network properties of human disease-genes - hubs are unlikely to cause disease, but if they do, they usually cause multiple disorders. CONCLUSIONS HINT is of significant interest to researchers in all fields of biology as it addresses the ubiquitous need of having a repository of high-quality protein-protein interactions. These datasets can be utilized to generate specific hypotheses about specific proteins and/or pathways, as well as analyzing global properties of cellular networks. HINT will be regularly updated and all versions will be tracked.},

abstract = {Experimental evidence and theoretical models both suggest that protein folding begins by specific short regions of the polypeptide chain intermittently assuming conformations close to their final ones. The independent folding properties and small size of these folding initiation sites make them suitable subjects for computational methods aimed at deriving structure from sequence. We have used a torsion space Monte Carlo procedure together with an all-atom free energy function to investigate the folding of a set of such sites. The free energy function is derived by a potential of mean force analysis of experimental protein structures. The most important contributions to the total free energy are the local main chain electrostatics, main chain hydrogen bonds, and the burial of nonpolar area. Six proposed independent folding units and four control peptides 11-14 residues long have been investigated. Thirty Monte Carlo simulations were performed on each peptide, starting from different random conformations. Five of the six folding units adopted conformations close to the experimental ones in some of the runs. None of the controls did so, as expected. The generated conformations which are close to the experimental ones have among the lowest free energies encountered, although some less native like low free energy conformations were also found. The effectiveness of the method on these peptides, which have a wide variety of experimental conformations, is encouraging in two ways: First, it provides independent evidence that these regions of the sequences are able to adopt native like conformations early in folding, and therefore are most probably key components of the folding pathways. Second, it demonstrates that available simulation methods and free energy functions are able to produce reasonably accurate structures. Extensions of the methods to the folding of larger portions of proteins are suggested.},

abstract = {Unfolded peptides in water have some residual structure that may be important in the folding process, and the nature of the residual structure is currently of much interest. There is a neighboring residue effect on backbone conformation, discovered in 1997 from measurements of (3)J(HN alpha) coupling constants. The neighboring residue effect appears also in the "coil library" of Protein Data Bank structures of residues not in alpha-helix and not in beta-structure. When a neighboring residue (i - 1 or i + 1) belongs to class L (aromatic and beta-branched amino acids, FHITVWY) rather than class S (all others, G and P excluded), then the backbone angle of residue i is more negative for essentially all amino acids. Calculated values of peptide solvation (electrostatic solvation free energy, ESF) predict basic properties of the neighboring residue effect. We show that L amino acids reduce the solvation of neighboring peptide groups more than S amino acids. When tripeptides from the coil library are excised to allow solvation, the central residues have more negative values of {\textless}phi{\textgreater} but less negative values of {\textless}ESF{\textgreater} with L than with S neighbors. The coil library values of {\textless}(3)J(HN alpha){\textgreater}, which vary strikingly among the amino acids, are correlated with the neighboring residue effect seen by ESF. Moreover, values for the "blocking effect" of side chains on the hydrogen exchange rates of peptide NH protons are correlated with ESF values.},

abstract = {This paper reports an extensive sequence analysis of the alpha-helices of proteins. alpha-Helices were extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and were divided into groups according to their sizes. It was found that some amino acids had differential propensity values for adopting helical conformation in short, medium and long alpha-helices. Pro and Trp had a significantly higher propensity for helical conformation in short helices than in medium and long helices. Trp was the strongest helix conformer in short helices. Sequence patterns favoring helical conformation were derived from a neighbor-dependent sequence analysis of proteins, which calculated the effect of neighboring amino acid type on the propensity of residues for adopting a particular secondary structure in proteins. This method produced an enhanced statistical significance scale that allowed us to explore the positional preference of amino acids for alpha-helical conformations. It was shown that the amino acid pair preference for alpha-helix had a unique pattern and this pattern was not always predictable by assuming proportional contributions from the individual propensity values of the amino acids. Our analysis also yielded a series of amino acid dyads that showed preference for alpha-helix conformation. The data presented in this study, along with our previous study on loop sequences of proteins, should prove useful for developing potential 'codes' for recognizing sequence patterns that are favorable for specific secondary structural elements in proteins.},

In an alpha-helix, the first four {\textgreater}N-H groups and last four {\textgreater}C=O groups necessarily lack intrahelical hydrogen bonds. Instead, such groups are often capped by alternative hydrogen bond partners. This review enlarges our earlier hypothesis (Presta LG, Rose GD. 1988. Helix signals in proteins. Science 240:1632-1641) to include hydrophobic capping. A hydrophobic interaction that straddles the helix terminus is always associated with hydrogen-bonded capping. From a global survey among proteins of known structure, seven distinct capping motifs are identified-three at the helix N-terminus and four at the C-terminus. The consensus sequence patterns of these seven motifs, together with results from simple molecular modeling, are used to formulate useful rules of thumb for helix termination. Finally, we examine the role of helix capping as a bridge linking the conformation of secondary structure to supersecondary structure.},

abstract = {Protein structure determination and predictive modeling have long been guided by the paradigm that the peptide backbone has a single, context-independent ideal geometry. Both quantum-mechanics calculations and empirical analyses have shown this is an incorrect simplification in that backbone covalent geometry actually varies systematically as a function of the $\phi${\{}symbol{\}} and $\Psi$ backbone dihedral angles. Here, we use a nonredundant set of ultrahigh-resolution protein structures to define these conformation-dependent variations. The trends have a rational, structural basis that can be explained by avoidance of atomic clashes or optimization of favorable electrostatic interactions. To facilitate adoption of this paradigm, we have created a conformation-dependent library of covalent bond lengths and bond angles and shown that it has improved accuracy over existing methods without any additional variables to optimize. Protein structures derived from crystallographic refinement and predictive modeling both stand to benefit from incorporation of the paradigm. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The preferences of amino acid residues for ,psi backbone angles vary strikingly among the amino acids, as shown by the backbone angle found from the (3)J(H(alpha),H(N)) coupling constant for short peptides in water. New data for the (3)J(H(alpha),H(N)) values of blocked amino acids (dipeptides) are given here. Dipeptides exhibit the full range of coupling constants shown by longer peptides such as GGXGG and dipeptides present the simplest system for analyzing backbone preferences. The dipeptide coupling constants are surprisingly close to values computed from the coil library (conformations of residues not in helices and not in sheets). Published coupling constants for GGXGG peptides agree closely with dipeptide values for all nonpolar residues and for some polar residues but not for X = D, N, T, and Y, which are probably affected by polar side chain-backbone interactions in GGXGG peptides. Thus, intrinsic backbone preferences are already determined at the dipeptide level and remain almost unchanged in GGXGG peptides and are strikingly similar in the coil library of conformations from protein structures. The simplest explanation for the backbone preferences is that backbone conformations are strongly affected by electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions in the peptide backbone and by screening of these interactions with water, which depends on nearby side chains. Strong backbone electrostatic interactions occur in dipeptides. This is shown by calculations both of backbone electrostatic energy for different conformers of the alanine dipeptide in the gas phase and by electrostatic solvation free energies of amino acid dipeptides.},

Here, to investigate the neighbor interaction effects on the conformational propensities of amino-acids, we carried out (1)H NMR experiments for a comprehensive set of blocked dipeptides and measured the scalar coupling constants between alpha protons and amide protons as well as their chemical shifts. Detailed inspection of these NMR properties shows that, irrespective of amino-acid side-chain properties, the distributions of the measured coupling constants and chemical shifts of the dipeptides are comparatively narrow, indicating small variances of their conformation distributions. They are further compared with those of blocked amino-acids (Ac-X-NHMe), oligopeptides (Ac-GGXGG-NH(2)), and native (lysozyme), denatured (lysozyme and outer membrane protein X from Escherichia coli), unstructured (Domain 2 of the protein 5A of Hepatitis C virus), and intrinsically disordered (hNlg3cyt: intracellular domain of human NL3) proteins. These comparative investigations suggest that the conformational preferences and local solvation environments of the blocked dipeptides are quite similar to not only those of other short oligopeptides but also those of denatured and natively unfolded proteins.},

The molten globule is a highly dynamic form with native-like secondary structure and a loose protein core that admits solvent. The related (but still controversial) dry molten globule is an expanded form of the native protein with largely intact topology but a tighter protein core that excludes solvent. Neither form retains side chain close-packing, and therefore both structure and function must result from other factors, assuming that the reality of the dry molten globule is accepted.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Independently evolving lineages mostly accumulate different changes, which leads to their gradual divergence. However, parallel accumulation of identical changes is also common, especially in traits with only a small number of possible states. RESULTS: We characterize parallelism in evolution of coding sequences in three four-species sets of genomes of mammals, Drosophila, and yeasts. Each such set contains two independent evolutionary paths, which we call paths I and II. An amino acid replacement which occurred along path I also occurs along path II with the probability 50-80{\%} of that expected under selective neutrality. Thus, the per site rate of parallel evolution of proteins is several times higher than their average rate of evolution, but still lower than the rate of evolution of neutral sequences. This deficit may be caused by changes in the fitness landscape, leading to a replacement being possible along path I but not along path II. However, constant, weak selection assumed by the nearly neutral model of evolution appears to be a more likely explanation. Then, the average coefficient of selection associated with an amino acid replacement, in the units of the effective population size, must exceed approximately 0.4, and the fraction of effectively neutral replacements must be below approximately 30{\%}. At a majority of evolvable amino acid sites, only a relatively small number of different amino acids is permitted. CONCLUSION: High, but below-neutral, rates of parallel amino acid replacements suggest that a majority of amino acid replacements that occur in evolution are subject to weak, but non-trivial, selection, as predicted by Ohta's nearly-neutral theory.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing projects are producing linear amino acid sequences, but full understanding of the biological role of these proteins will require knowledge of their structure and function. Although experimental structure determination methods are providing high-resolution structure information about a subset of the proteins, computational structure prediction methods will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose structures will not be determined experimentally. The first class of protein structure prediction methods, including threading and comparative modeling, rely on detectable similarity spanning most of the modeled sequence and at least one known structure. The second class of methods, de novo or ab initio methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on similarity at the fold level between the modeled sequence and any of the known structures. In this Viewpoint, we begin by describing the essential features of the methods, the accuracy of the models, and their application to the prediction and understanding of protein function, both for single proteins and on the scale of whole genomes. We then discuss the important role that protein structure prediction methods play in the growing worldwide effort in structural genomics.},

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

abstract = {Proteins can be very tolerant to amino acid substitution, even within their core. Understanding the factors responsible for this behavior is of critical importance for protein engineering and design. Mutations in proteins have been quantified in terms of the changes in stability they induce. For example, guest residues in specific secondary structures have been used as probes of conformational preferences of amino acids, yielding propensity scales. Predicting these amino acid propensities would be a good test of any new potential energy functions used to mimic protein stability. We have recently developed a protein design procedure that optimizes whole sequences for a given target conformation based on the knowledge of the template backbone and on a semiempirical potential energy function. This energy function is purely physical, including steric interactions based on a Lennard-Jones potential, electrostatics based on a Coulomb potential, and hydrophobicity in the form of an environment free energy based on accessible surface area and interatomic contact areas. Sequences designed by this procedure for 10 different proteins were analyzed to extract conformational preferences for amino acids. The resulting structure-based propensity scales show significant agreements with experimental propensity scale values, both for alpha-helices and beta-sheets. These results indicate that amino acid conformational preferences are a natural consequence of the potential energy we use. This confirms the accuracy of our potential and indicates that such preferences should not be added as a design criterion.},

The GGXGG peptide series is often used as a model of the unstructured denatured state of proteins. The sampling in the peptide MD simulations is neither random nor uniform. Instead, individual amino acids show preferences for particular conformations, but the peptide is dynamic, and interconversion between conformers is facile. For a given amino acid, the (Phi,Psi) distributions in the protein simulations and the Protein Data Bank are very similar and often distinct from those in the peptide simulations. Comparison between the peptide and protein simulations shows that packing constraints, solvation, and the tendency for particular amino acids to be used for specific structural motifs can overwhelm the "intrinsic propensities" of amino acids for particular (Phi,Psi) conformations. We also compare our helical propensities with experimental consensus values using the host-guest method, which appear to be determined largely by context and not necessarily the intrinsic conformational propensities of the guest residues. These simulations represent an improved coil library free from contextual effects to better model intrinsic conformational propensities and provide a detailed view of conformations making up the "random coil" state.},

One is a result of the misinterpretation of Anfinsen's Thermodynamic hypothesis which led to the conclusion that the native structure of a protein must be at a global minimum of the Gibbs energy. The second is the result of the adherence to the hydrophobic paradigm, and at the same time ignoring a whole repertoire of hydrophilic effects. It is argued that switching from a target-based to a caused-based approach, and adopting the hydrophilic paradigm leads straightforwardly to a simple answer to Levinthal's question, as well as to a solution of the PFP.},

abstract = {The following three issues concerning the backbone dihedral angles of protein structures are presented. (1) How do the dihedral angles of the 20 amino acids depend on the identity and conformation of their nearest residues? (2) To what extent are the native dihedral angles determined by local (dihedral) potentials? (3) How to build a knowledge-based potential for a residue's dihedral angles, considering the identity and conformation of its nearest residues? We find that the dihedral angle distribution for a residue can significantly depend on the identity and conformation of its adjacent residues. These correlations are in sharp contrast to the Flory isolated-pair hypothesis. Statistical potentials are built for all combinations of residue triplets and depend on the dihedral angles between consecutive residues. First, a low-resolution potential is obtained, which only differentiates between the main populated basins in the dihedral angle density plots. Minimization of the dihedral potential for 125 test proteins reveals that most native ??-helical residues (89{\%}) and a large fraction of native ??-sheet residues (47{\%}) adopt conformations close to their native one. For native loop residues, the percentage is 48{\%}. It is also found that this fraction is higher for residues away from the ends of ?? or ?? secondary structure elements. In addition, a higher resolution potential is built as a function of dihedral angles by a smoothing procedure and continuous functions interpolations. Monte Carlo energy minimization with this potential results in a lower fraction for native ??-sheet residues. Nevertheless, because of the higher flexibility and entropy of ?? structures, they could be preferred under the influence of non-local interactions. In general, most ??-helices and many ??-sheets are strongly determined by the local potential, while the conformations in loops and near the end of ??-sheets are more influenced by non-local interactions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Point mutations of even a single amino acid residue in the helices of the non-redundant database may lead to sequentially identical peptides which adopt different secondary structures in different proteins. However, various physico-chemical factors which govern the formation of these ambivalent helices generated by point mutations of a sequence are not clearly known.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Sequences generated by point mutations of helices are mapped on to their non-helical counterparts in the SCOP database. The results show that short helices are prone to transform into non-helical conformations upon point mutations. Mutation of amino acid residues by helix breakers preferentially yield non-helical conformations, while mutation with residues of intermediate helix propensity display least preferences for non-helical conformations. Differences in the solvent accessibility of the mutating/mutated residues are found to be a major criteria for these sequences to conform to non-helical conformations. Even with minimal differences in the amino acid distributions of the sequences flanking the helical and non-helical conformations, helix-flanking sequences are found be more solvent accessible.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: All types of mutations from helical to non-helical conformations are investigated. The primary factors attributing such changes in conformation can be: i) type/propensity of the mutating and mutant residues ii) solvent accessibility of the residue at the mutation site iii) context/environment dependence of the flanking sequences.

To this end, we modeled dipeptides by using a van der Waals energy function and derived Ramachandran plots for each of the amino acids. These data were used to determine the entropy and Helmholtz free energy of placing each amino acid in the beta-sheet region of phi-psi space.

Many have attempted to investigate neighboring residue effects to aid in our understanding of protein folding and improve structure prediction efforts, especially with respect to difficult to characterize states, such as disordered or unfolded states. Host–guest peptide series are a useful tool in examining the propensities of the amino acids free from the surrounding protein structure. Here, we compare the distributions of the backbone dihedral angles ($\phi$/$\psi$) of the 20 proteogenic amino acids in two different sequence contexts using the AAXAA and GGXGG host–guest pentapeptide series. We further examine their intrinsic behaviors across three environmental contexts: water at 298 K, water at 498 K, and 8 M urea at 298 K. The GGXGG systems provide the intrinsic amino acid propensities devoid of any conformational context. The alanine residues in the AAXAA series enforce backbone chirality, thereby providing a model of the intrinsic behavior of amino acids in a protein chain. Our results show modest differences in $\phi$/$\psi$ distributions due to the steric constraints of the Ala side chains, the magnitudes of which are dependent on the denaturing conditions. One of the strongest factors modulating $\phi$/$\psi$ distributions was the protonation of titratable side chains, and the largest differences observed were in the amino acid propensities for the rarely sampled $\alpha$L region.},

Comparison to this random-coil baseline, through secondary chemical shifts, is used to infer protein secondary structure. The use of these random-coil data sets rests on the perception that the reference chemical shifts arise from states where there is little or no conformational bias. However, there is growing evidence that the conformational composition of natively and nonnatively unfolded proteins fail to approach anything that can be construed as random coil. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of an alanine-based host-guest peptide series (AAXAA) as a model of unfolded and denatured states to examine the intrinsic propensities of the amino acids. We produced ensembles that are in good agreement with the experimental NMR chemical shifts and confirm that the sampling of the 20 natural amino acids in this peptide series is be far from random. Preferences toward certain regions of conformational space were both present and dependent upon the environment when compared under conditions typically used to denature proteins, i.e., thermal and chemical denaturation. Moreover, the simulations allowed us to examine the conformational makeup of the underlying ensembles giving rise to the ensemble-averaged chemical shifts. We present these data as an intrinsic backbone propensity library that forms part of our Structural Library of Intrinsic Residue Propensities to inform model building, to aid in interpretation of experiment, and for structure prediction of natively and nonnatively unfolded states.},

Addition of organic osmolytes, small uncharged compounds found throughout nature, shift this equilibrium. Urea, a denaturing osmolyte, shifts the equilibrium toward U; trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a protecting osmolyte, shifts the equilibrium toward N. Using the Tanford Transfer Model, the thermodynamic response to many such osmolytes has been dissected into groupwise free energy contributions. It is found that the energetics involving backbone hydrogen bonding controls these shifts in protein stability almost entirely, with osmolyte cosolvents simply dialing between solvent-backbone versus backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, as a function of solvent quality. This reciprocal relationship establishes the essential link between protein thermodynamics and the protein's hydrogen-bonded backbone structure.},

abstract = {The p53 transactivation domain (p53TAD) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) domain that undergoes coupled folding and binding when interacting with partner proteins like the E3 ligase, MDM2, and the 70 kDa subunit of replication protein A, RPA70. The secondary structure and dynamics of six closely related mammalian homologues of p53TAD were investigated using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Differences in both transient secondary structure and backbone dynamics were observed for the homologues. Many of these differences were localized to the binding sites for MDM2 and RPA70. The amount of transient helical secondary structure observed for the MDM2 binding site was lower for the Dog and Mouse homologues, compared with human, and the amount of transient helical secondary structure observed for the RPA70 binding site was higher for Guinea Pig and Rabbit, compared with human. Differences in the amount of transient helical secondary structure observed for the MDM2 binding site were directly related to amino acid substitutions occurring on the solvent exposed side of the amphipathic helix that forms during the p53TAD/MDM2 interaction. Differences in the amount of transient helical secondary structure were not as easily explained for the RPA70 binding site due to its extensive sequence divergence. Clustering analysis shows that the divergence in the transient secondary structure of the p53TAD homologues exceeds the amino acid sequence divergence. In contrast, strong correlations were observed between the backbone dynamics of the homologues and the sequence identity matrix, suggesting that the dynamic behavior of IDPs is a conserved evolutionary feature. {\textcopyright} Proteins 2013;. {\textcopyright} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The environments are described by: (i) the area of the residue buried in the protein and inaccessible to solvent; (ii) the fraction of side-chain area that is covered by polar atoms (O and N); and (iii) the local secondary structure. Examples of this 3D profile method are presented for four families of proteins: the globins, cyclic AMP (adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate) receptor-like proteins, the periplasmic binding proteins, and the actins. This method is able to detect the structural similarity of the actins and 70- kilodalton heat shock proteins, even though these protein families share no detectable sequence similarity.},

abstract = {Understanding molecular kinetics, and particularly protein folding, is a classic grand challenge in molecular biophysics. Network models, such as Markov state models (MSMs), are one potential solution to this problem. MSMs have recently yielded quantitative agreement with experimentally derived structures and folding rates for specific systems, leaving them positioned to potentially provide a deeper understanding of molecular kinetics that can lead to experimentally testable hypotheses. Here we use existing MSMs for the villin headpiece and NTL9, which were constructed from atomistic simulations, to accomplish this goal. In addition, we provide simpler, humanly comprehensible networks that capture the essence of molecular kinetics and reproduce qualitative phenomena like the apparent two-state folding often seen in experiments. Together, these models show that protein dynamics are dominated by stochastic jumps between numerous metastable states and that proteins have heterogeneous unfolded states (many unfolded basins that interconvert more rapidly with the native state than with one another) yet often still appear two-state. Most importantly, we find that protein native states are hubs that can be reached quickly from any other state. However, metastability and a web of nonnative states slow the average folding rate. Experimental tests for these findings and their implications for other fields, like protein design, are also discussed.},

abstract = {Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder order transition called "folding." The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.},

abstract = {Protein folding is an inherently complex process involving coordination of the intricate networks of weak interactions that stabilize native three-dimensional structures. In the conventional paradigm, simple protein structures are assumed to fold in an all-or-none process that is inaccessible to experiment. Existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly. A widely used approach interprets changes in protein stability and/or folding kinetics, induced by engineered mutations, in terms of the structure of the native protein. In addition to limitations in connecting energetics with structure, mutational methods have significant experimental uncertainties and are unable to map complex networks of interactions. In contrast, analytical theory predicts small barriers to folding and the possibility of downhill folding. These theoretical predictions have been confirmed experimentally in recent years, including the observation of global downhill folding. However, a key remaining question is whether downhill folding can indeed lead to the high-resolution analysis of protein folding processes. Here we show, with the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), that the downhill protein BBL from Escherichia coli unfolds atom by atom starting from a defined three-dimensional structure. Thermal unfolding data on 158 backbone and side-chain protons out of a total of 204 provide a detailed view of the structural events during folding. This view confirms the statistical nature of folding, and exposes the interplay between hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic forces, backbone conformation and side-chain entropy. From the data we also obtain a map of the interaction network in this protein, which reveals the source of folding cooperativity. Our approach can be extended to other proteins with marginal barriers (less than 3RT), providing a new tool for the study of protein folding.},

@article{Levinthal1968a,
abstract = {Models of protein energetics that neglect interactions between amino acids that are not adjacent in the native state, such as the Go model, encode or underlie many influential ideas on protein folding. Implicit in this simplification is a crucial assumption that has never been critically evaluated in a broad context: Detailed mechanisms of protein folding are not biased by nonnative contacts, typically argued to be a consequence of sequence design and/or topology. Here we present, using computer simulations of a well-studied lattice heteropolymer model, the first systematic test of this oft-assumed correspondence over the statistically significant range of hundreds of thousands of amino acid sequences that fold to the same native structure. Contrary to previous conjectures, we find a multiplicity of folding mechanisms, suggesting that Go-like models cannot be justified by considerations of topology alone. Instead, we find that the crucial factor in discriminating among topological pathways is the heterogeneity of native contact energies: The order in which native contacts accumulate is profoundly insensitive to omission of nonnative interactions, provided that native contact heterogeneity is retained. This robustness holds over a surprisingly wide range of folding rates for our designed sequences. Mirroring predictions based on the principle of minimum frustration, fast-folding sequences match their Go-like counterparts in both topological mechanism and transit times. Less optimized sequences dwell much longer in the unfolded state and/or off-pathway intermediates than do Go-like models. For dynamics that bridge unfolded and unfolded states, however, even slow folders exhibit topological mechanisms and transit times nearly identical with those of their Go-like counterparts. Our results do not imply a direct correspondence between folding trajectories of Go-like models and those of real proteins, but they do help to clarify key topological and energetic assumptions that are commonly used to justify such caricatures.},

In 1971 we began to search for protein folding intermediates by fast-reaction methods. We found the slow-folding and fast-folding forms of unfolded ribonuclease A, which led to the understanding that proline isomerization is sometimes part of the folding process. Using hydrogen exchange as a probe, we found the rapid formation of secondary structure during folding and used this to provide an NMR pulse labeling method for determining structures of folding intermediates. Our studies of peptide helices provided basic helix-coil parameters, also evidence for hierarchic folding, and further indicated that peptide hydrogen bonds are important in the energetics of folding.},

For more distantly related proteins, they do much less well; only one-half of the relationships between proteins with 20-30{\%} identity are found.

abstract = {The pathway which proteins take to fold can be influenced from the earliest events of structure formation. In this light, it was both predicted and confirmed that increasing the stiffness of a beta hairpin turn decreased the size of the transition state ensemble (TSE), while increasing the folding rate. Thus, there appears to be a relationship between conformationally restricting the TSE and increasing the folding rate, at least for beta hairpin turns. In this study, we hypothesize that the enormous sampling necessary to fold even two-state folding proteins in silico could be reduced if local structure constraints were used to restrict structural heterogeneity by polarizing folding pathways or forcing folding into preferred routes. Using a Gō model, we fold Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 (CI-2) and the src SH3 domain after constraining local sequence windows to their native structure by rigid body dynamics (RBD). Trajectories were monitored for any changes to the folding pathway and differences in the kinetics compared with unconstrained simulations. Constraining local structure decreases folding time two-fold for 41{\%} of src SH3 windows and 45{\%} of CI-2 windows. For both proteins, folding times are never significantly increased after constraining any window. Structural polarization of the folding pathway appears to explain these rate increases. Folding rate enhancements are consistent with the goal to reduce sampling time necessary to reach native structures during folding simulations. As anticipated, not all constrained windows showed an equal decrease in folding time. We conclude by analyzing these differences and explain why RBD may be the preferred way to constrain structure.},

abstract = {How does a folding protein negotiate a vast, featureless conformational landscape and adopt its native structure in biological real time? Motivated by this search problem, we developed a novel algorithm to compare protein structures. Procedures to identify structural analogs are typically conducted in three-dimensional space: the tertiary structure of a target protein is matched against each candidate in a database of structures, and goodness of fit is evaluated by a distance-based measure, such as the root-mean-square distance between target and candidate. This is an expensive approach because three-dimensional space is complex. Here, we transform the problem into a simpler one-dimensional procedure. Specifically, we identify and label the 11 most populated residue basins in a database of high-resolution protein structures. Using this 11-letter alphabet, any protein's three-dimensional structure can be transformed into a one-dimensional string by mapping each residue onto its corresponding basin. Similarity between the resultant basin strings can then be evaluated by conventional sequence-based comparison. The disorder → order folding transition is abridged on both sides. At the onset, folding conditions necessitate formation of hydrogen-bonded scaffold elements on which proteins are assembled, severely restricting the magnitude of accessible conformational space. Near the end, chain topology is established prior to emergence of the close-packed native state. At this latter stage of folding, the chain remains molten, and residues populate natural basins that are approximated by the 11 basins derived here. In essence, our algorithm reduces the protein-folding search problem to mapping the amino acid sequence onto a restricted basin string.},

Oddly, the role of functional importance, mainly measured by essentiality, in determining evolutionary rate has been challenged in recent studies. Several variables other than protein essentiality, such as expression level, gene compactness, protein-protein interactions, etc., have been suggested to affect protein evolutionary rate. In the present review, we try to refine the concept of functional importance of a gene, and consider three factors-functional importance, expression level, and gene compactness, as independent determinants of evolutionary rate of a protein, based not only on their known correlation with evolutionary rate but also on a reasonable mechanistic model. We suggest a framework based on these mechanistic models to correctly interpret the correlations between evolutionary rates and the various variables as well as the interrelationships among the variables.},

abstract = {Using evolutionary information contained in multiple sequence alignments as input to neural networks, secondary structure can be predicted at significantly increased accuracy. Here, we extend our previous three-level system of neural networks by using additional input information derived from multiple alignments. Using a position-specific conservation weight as part of the input increases performance. Using the number of insertions and deletions reduces the tendency for overprediction and increases overall accuracy. Addition of the global amino acid content yields a further improvement, mainly in predicting structural class. The final network system has sustained overall accuracy of 71.6{\%} in a multiple cross-validation test on 126 unique protein chains. A test on a new set of 124 recently solved protein structures that have no significant sequence similarity to the learning set confirms the high level of accuracy. The average cross-validated accuracy for all 250 sequence-unique chains is above 72{\%}. Using various data sets, the method is compared to alternative prediction methods, some of which also use multiple alignments: the performance advantage of the network system is at least 6 percentage points in three-state accuracy. In addition, the network estimates secondary structure content from multiple sequence alignments about as well as circular dichroism spectroscopy on a single protein and classifies 75{\%} of the 250 proteins correctly into one of four protein structural classes. Of particular practical importance is the definition of a position-specific reliability index. For 40{\%} of all residues the method has a sustained three-state accuracy of 88{\%}, as high as the overall average for homology modelling. A further strength of the method is greatly increased accuracy in predicting the placement of secondary structure segments.},

abstract = {We show that amino acid covariation in proteins, extracted from the evolutionary sequence record, can be used to fold transmembrane proteins. We use this technique to predict previously unknown 3D structures for 11 transmembrane proteins (with up to 14 helices) from their sequences alone. The prediction method (EVfold-membrane) applies a maximum entropy approach to infer evolutionary covariation in pairs of sequence positions within a protein family and then generates all-atom models with the derived pairwise distance constraints. We benchmark the approach with blinded de novo computation of known transmembrane protein structures from 23 families, demonstrating unprecedented accuracy of the method for large transmembrane proteins. We show how the method can predict oligomerization, functional sites, and conformational changes in transmembrane proteins. With the rapid rise in large-scale sequencing, more accurate and more comprehensive information on evolutionary constraints can be decoded from genetic variation, greatly expanding the repertoire of transmembrane proteins amenable to modeling by this method. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {It has long been believed that nucleation of the alpha-helix is a very fast reaction, occurring in around 10(-7) s. We show here that helix nucleation, in fact, takes place on the millisecond time scale. The rate of alpha-helix nucleation in two polyalanine-based peptides and in lysine and glutamic acid homopolymers was measured directly by stopped-flow deep UV CD with synchrotron radiation as the light source. Synchrotron radiation CD gives far superior signal to noise than a conventional instrument. The 16-aa AK peptide folds with first-order kinetics and a rate constant of 15 s-1 at 0 degrees C. The rate-determining step is presumably the initiation of a new helix, which occurs at least 10(5) times slower than expected. Helix folding occurs in at least two steps on the millisecond time scale for the longer peptides, with a transient overshoot of helix content significantly greater than at equilibrium, similar to that seen in the folding of several proteins. We suggest that the overshoot is caused by the formation of a single long helix followed by its breakage into the two or more helices present at equilibrium.},

These beta-breaker residues are at the origin of the kink between the beta-strand and the turn that precedes or follows it. beta-Breakers can be located automatically using a consensus approach based on algorithmic secondary structure assignment, solvent accessibility and backbone dihedral angles. These beta-breakers are conformationally homogeneous with respect to side-chain solvent accessibility and backbone dihedral angle profile. A sequence-structure correlation is noted: a restricted subset of amino acids is observed at these positions. Analysis of homologous protein sequences shows that these residues are more highly conserved than other residues in the loop. We conclude that beta-breakers are the structural analogs of the N and C-terminal caps of alpha-helices.

Consequently, an extensive interplay of secondary and tertiary interactions determines the transition-state for folding, which is structurally similar to the native state, being formed in a general collapse (condensation) around a diffuse nucleus. As the propensity for stable secondary structure increases, folding becomes more hierarchical and eventually follows a framework mechanism where the transition state is assembled from pre-formed secondary structural elements.},

To illustrate these problems, this manuscript presents Rosetta results for four well-defined test cases: the 20-residue mini-protein Trp cage, an even smaller disulfide-stabilized conotoxin, the reactive loop of a serine protease inhibitor, and a UUCG RNA tetraloop. In contrast to previous Rosetta studies, several lines of evidence indicate that conformational sampling is not the major bottleneck in modeling these small systems. Instead, approximations and omissions in the Rosetta all-atom energy function currently preclude discriminating experimentally observed conformations from de novo models at atomic resolution.

By iteratively fixing secondary structure assignments of residues during Monte Carlo simulations of folding, our coarse-grained model without information concerning homology or explicit side chains can outperform current homology-based secondary structure prediction methods for many proteins. The computationally rapid algorithm using only single (phi,psi) dihedral angle moves also generates tertiary structures of accuracy comparable with existing all-atom methods for many small proteins, particularly those with low homology. Hence, given appropriate search strategies and scoring functions, reduced representations can be used for accurately predicting secondary structure and providing 3D structures, thereby increasing the size of proteins approachable by homology-free methods and the accuracy of template methods that depend on a high-quality input secondary structure.},

abstract = {This article is a personal perspective on the developments in the field of protein folding over approximately the last 40 years. In addition to its historical aspects, the article presents a view of the principles of protein folding with particular emphasis on the relationship of these principles to the problem of protein structure prediction. It is argued that despite much that is new, the essential elements of our current understanding of protein folding were anticipated by researchers many years ago. These elements include the recognition of the central importance of the polypeptide backbone as a determinant of protein conformation, hierarchical protein folding, and multiple folding pathways. Important areas of progress include a detailed characterization of the folding pathways of a number of proteins and a fundamental understanding of the physical chemical forces that determine protein stability. Despite these developments, fold prediction algorithms still encounter difficulties in identifying the correct fold for a given sequence. This may be due to the possibility that the free energy differences between at least a few alternate conformations of many proteins are not large. Significant progress in protein structure prediction has been due primarily to the explosive growth of sequence and structural databases. However, further progress is likely to depend in part on the ability to combine information available from databases with principles and algorithms derived from physical chemical studies of protein folding. An approach to the integration of the two areas is outlined with specific reference to the PrISM program that is a fully integrated sequence/structural-analysis/fold-recognition/homology model building software system.},

abstract = {Helix formation is an elementary process in protein folding, influencing both the rate and mechanism of the global folding reaction. Yet, because helix formation is less cooperative than protein folding, the kinetics are often multiexponential, and the observed relaxation times are not straightforwardly related to the microscopic rates for helix nucleation and elongation. Recent ultrafast spectroscopic measurements on the peptide Ac-WAAAH(+)-NH(2) were best fit by two relaxation modes on the ∼0.1-1 ns time scale, (1) apparently much faster than had previously been experimentally inferred for helix nucleation. Here, we use replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations with an optimized all-atom protein force field (Amber ff03w) and an accurate water model (TIP4P/2005) to study the kinetics of helix formation in this peptide. We calculate temperature-dependent microscopic rate coefficients from the simulations by treating the dynamics between helical states as a Markov process using a recently developed formalism. The fluorescence relaxation curves obtained from simulated temperature jumps are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined results. We find that the kinetics are multiphasic but can be approximated well by a double-exponential function. The major processes contributing to the relaxation are the shrinking of helical states at the C-terminal end and a faster re-equilibration among coil states. Despite the fast observed relaxation, the helix nucleation time is estimated from our model to be 20-70 ns at 300 K, with a dependence on temperature well described by Arrhenius kinetics.},

abstract = {Fold recognition from sequence can be an important step in protein structure and function prediction. Many methods have tackled this goal. Most of them, based on sequence alignment, fail for sequences of low similarity. Alignment-free approaches can provide an efficient alternative. For such approaches, the identification of efficient fold discriminatory features is critical. We propose a new fold recognition approach that relies on the encoding of the local structure of proteins using a Hidden Markov Model Structural Alphabet. This encoding provides a 1D description of the conformation of complete proteins structures, including loops. At the fold level, compared with the classical secondary structure helix, strand, and coil states, such encoding is expected to provide the means of a better discrimination between loop conformations, hence providing better fold identification. Compared with previous related approaches, this supplement of information results in significant improvement. When combining this information with supplementary information of secondary structure and residue burial, we obtain a fold recognition accuracy of 78{\%} for 27 protein families, that is, 8{\%} higher than the best available method so far, and of 68{\%} for 60 families. Corresponding scores at the class level are of 92{\%} and 90{\%} indicating that mispredictions are mostly within structural classes.},

abstract = {While the classical view of protein folding kinetics relies on phenomenological models, and regards folding intermediates in a structural way, the new view emphasizes the ensemble nature of protein conformations. Although folding has sometimes been regarded as a linear sequence of events, the new view sees folding as parallel microscopic multi-pathway diffusion-like processes. While the classical view invoked pathways to solve the problem of searching for the needle in the haystack, the pathway idea was then seen as conflicting with Anfinsen's experiments showing that folding is pathway-independent (Levinthal's paradox). In contrast, the new view sees no inherent paradox because it eliminates the pathway idea: folding can funnel to a single stable state by multiple routes in conformational space. The general energy landscape picture provides a conceptual framework for understanding both two-state and multi-state folding kinetics. Better tests of these ideas will come when new experiments become available for measuring not just averages of structural observables, but also correlations among their fluctuations. At that point we hope to learn much more about the real shapes of protein folding landscapes.},

The identification of potentially remote homologues to be used as templates for modeling target sequences of unknown structure and their accurate alignment remain challenges, despite many years of study. The most recent advances have been in combining as many sources of information as possible - including amino acid variation in the form of profiles or hidden Markov models for both the target and template families, known and predicted secondary structures of the template and target, respectively, the combination of structure alignment for distant homologues and sequence alignment for close homologues to build better profiles, and the anchoring of certain regions of the alignment based on existing biological data. Newer technologies have been applied to the problem, including the use of support vector machines to tackle the fold classification problem for a target sequence and the alignment of hidden Markov models. Finally, using the consensus of many fold recognition methods, whether based on profile-profile alignments, threading or other approaches, continues to be one of the most successful strategies for both recognition and alignment of remote homologues. Although there is still room for improvement in identification and alignment methods, additional progress may come from model building and refinement methods that can compensate for large structural changes between remotely related targets and templates, as well as for regions of misalignment. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The techniques involving secondary structural features include prediction of secondary structure, membrane-spanning regions, and secondary structural class. At the tertiary structural level, methods for threading a sequence into a mainchain fold, homology modeling and assigning sequences to protein families with similar folds are discussed. A literature analysis suggests that, to date, threading techniques are not able to show their superiority over sequence pattern recognition methods. Recent progress in the state of ab initio structure calculation is reviewed in detail. The analysis shows that many structural features can be predicted from the amino acid sequence much better than just a few years ago and with attendant utility in experimental research. Best prediction can be achieved for new protein sequences that can be assigned to well-studied protein families. For single sequences without homologues, the folding problem has not yet been solved.},

abstract = {The understanding, and even the description of protein folding is impeded by the complexity of the process. Much of this complexity can be described and understood by taking a statistical approach to the energetics of protein conformation, that is, to the energy landscape. The statistical energy landscape approach explains when and why unique behaviors, such as specific folding pathways, occur in some proteins and more generally explains the distinction between folding processes common to all sequences and those peculiar to individual sequences. This approach also gives new, quantitative insights into the interpretation of experiments and simulations of protein folding thermodynamics and kinetics. Specifically, the picture provides simple explanations for folding as a two-state first-order phase transition, for the origin of metastable collapsed unfolded states and for the curved Arrhenius plots observed in both laboratory experiments and discrete lattice simulations. The relation of these quantitative ideas to folding pathways, to uniexponential vs. multiexponential behavior in protein folding experiments and to the effect of mutations on folding is also discussed. The success of energy landscape ideas in protein structure prediction is also described. The use of the energy landscape approach for analyzing data is illustrated with a quantitative analysis of some recent simulations, and a qualitative analysis of experiments on the folding of three proteins. The work unifies several previously proposed ideas concerning the mechanism protein folding and delimits the regions of validity of these ideas under different thermodynamic conditions. {\textcopyright} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {How do proteins fold, and why do they fold in that way? This Perspective integrates earlier and more recent advances over the 50-y history of the protein folding problem, emphasizing unambiguously clear structural information. Experimental results show that, contrary to prior belief, proteins are multistate rather than two-state objects. They are composed of separately cooperative foldon building blocks that can be seen to repeatedly unfold and refold as units even under native conditions. Similarly, foldons are lost as units when proteins are destabilized to produce partially unfolded equilibrium molten globules. In kinetic folding, the inherently cooperative nature of foldons predisposes the thermally driven amino acid-level search to form an initial foldon and subsequent foldons in later assisted searches. The small size of foldon units, ∼ 20 residues, resolves the Levinthal time-scale search problem. These microscopic-level search processes can be identified with the disordered multitrack search envisioned in the "new view" model for protein folding. Emergent macroscopic foldon-foldon interactions then collectively provide the structural guidance and free energy bias for the ordered addition of foldons in a stepwise pathway that sequentially builds the native protein. These conclusions reconcile the seemingly opposed new view and defined pathway models; the two models account for different stages of the protein folding process. Additionally, these observations answer the "how" and the "why" questions. The protein folding pathway depends on the same foldon units and foldon-foldon interactions that construct the native structure.},

In simulations conducted with a single physics-based energy function, the proteins, representing all three major structural classes, spontaneously and repeatedly fold to their experimentally determined native structures. Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form. In most cases, folding follows a single dominant route in which elements of the native structure appear in an order highly correlated with their propensity to form in the unfolded state.},

Repeat proteins composed of multiple tandem copies of a modular structure unit1 are widespread in nature and have critical roles in molecular recognition, signalling, and other essential biological processes2. Naturally occurring repeat proteins have been re-engineered for molecular recognition and modular scaffolding applications3–5. Here we use computational protein design to investigate the space of folded structures that can be generated by tandem repeating a simple helix–loop–helix–loop structural motif. Eighty-three designs with sequences unrelated to known repeat proteins were experimentally characterized. Of these, 53 are monomeric and stable at 95 °C, and 43 have solution X-ray scattering spectra consistent with the design models. Crystal structures of 15 designs spanning a broad range of curvatures are in close agreement with the design models with root mean square deviations ranging from 0.7 to 2.5 {\AA}. Our results show that existing repeat proteins occupy only a small fraction of the possible repeat protein sequence and structure space and that it is possible to design novel repeat proteins with precisely specified geometries, opening up a wide array of new possibilities for biomolecular engineering.},

abstract = {The pathways by which proteins fold into their specific native structure are still an unsolved mystery. Currently, many methods for protein structure prediction are available, and most of them tackle the problem by relying on the vast amounts of data collected from known protein structures. These methods are often not concerned with the route the protein follows to reach its final fold. This work is based on the premise that proteins fold in a hierarchical manner. We present FOBIA, an automated method for predicting a protein structure. FOBIA consists of two main stages: the first finds matches between parts of the target sequence and independently folding structural units using profile-profile comparison. The second assembles these units into a 3D structure by searching and ranking their possible orientations toward each other using a docking-based approach. We have previously reported an application of an initial version of this strategy to homology based targets. Since then we have considerably enhanced our method's abilities to allow it to address the more difficult template-based target category. This allows us to now apply FOBIA to the template-based targets of CASP8 and to show that it is both very efficient and promising. Our method can provide an alternative for template-based structure prediction, and in particular, the docking-basedranking technique presented here can be incorporated into any profile-profile comparison based method.},

Key developments over time include the HX pulse labeling method with nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, the fragment separation method, the addition to it of mass spectrometric (MS) analysis, and recent improvements in the HX MS technique and data analysis. Also, the discov-ery of protein foldons and their role supplies an essential interpretive link. Recent work using HX pulse labeling with MS analysis finds that a number of proteins fold by stepping through a reproducible sequence of native-like intermediates in an ordered pathway. The stepwise nature of the pathway is dictated by the cooperative foldon unit construction of the protein. The pathway order is determined by a sequential stabilization principle; prior native-like structure guides the formation of adjacent native-like structure. This view does not match the funneled energy landscape paradigm of a very large number of folding tracks, which was framed before foldons were known and is more appropriate for the unguided residue-level search to surmount an initial kinetic barrier rather than for the overall unfolded-state to native-state folding pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) is an efficient way to compare highly divergent sequences through the implicit secondary structure information directly derived from hydrophobic clusters. However, its efficiency and application are currently limited by the need of user expertise. In order to help the analysis of HCA plots, we report here the structural preferences of hydrophobic cluster species, which are frequently encountered in globular domains of proteins. These species are characterized only by their hydrophobic/non-hydrophobic dichotomy. This analysis has been extended to loop-forming clusters, using an appropriate loop alphabet.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The structural behavior of hydrophobic cluster species, which are typical of protein globular domains, was investigated within banks of experimental structures, considered at different levels of sequence redundancy. The 294 more frequent hydrophobic cluster species were analyzed with regard to their association with the different secondary structures (frequencies of association with secondary structures and secondary structure propensities). Hydrophobic cluster species are predominantly associated with regular secondary structures, and a large part (60 {\%}) reveals preferences for alpha-helices or beta-strands. Moreover, the analysis of the hydrophobic cluster amino acid composition generally allows for finer prediction of the regular secondary structure associated with the considered cluster within a cluster species. We also investigated the behavior of loop forming clusters, using a "PGDNS" alphabet. These loop clusters do not overlap with hydrophobic clusters and are highly associated with coils. Finally, the structural information contained in the hydrophobic structural words, as deduced from experimental structures, was compared to the PSI-PRED predictions, revealing that beta-strands and especially alpha-helices are generally over-predicted within the limits of typical beta and alpha hydrophobic clusters.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The dictionary of hydrophobic clusters described here can help the HCA user to interpret and compare the HCA plots of globular protein sequences, as well as provides an original fundamental insight into the structural bricks of protein folds. Moreover, the novel loop cluster analysis brings additional information for secondary structure prediction on the whole sequence through a generalized cluster analysis (GCA), and not only on regular secondary structures. Such information lays the foundations for developing a new and original tool for secondary structure prediction.},

The accuracy of ab initio secondary structure prediction from sequence, however, has only increased from around 77 to 80{\%} over the past decade. Here, we developed a multistep neural-network algorithm by coupling secondary structure prediction with prediction of solvent accessibility and backbone torsion angles in an iterative manner. Our method called SPINE X was applied to a dataset of 2640 proteins (25{\%} sequence identity cutoff) previously built for the first version of SPINE and achieved a 82.0{\%} accuracy based on 10-fold cross validation (Q(3)). Surpassing 81{\%} accuracy by SPINE X is further confirmed by employing an independently built test dataset of 1833 protein chains, a recently built dataset of 1975 proteins and 117 CASP 9 targets (critical assessment of structure prediction techniques) with an accuracy of 81.3{\%}, 82.3{\%} and 81.8{\%}, respectively. The prediction accuracy is further improved to 83.8{\%} for the dataset of 2640 proteins if the DSSP assignment used above is replaced by a more consistent consensus secondary structure assignment method. Comparison to the popular PSIPRED and CASP-winning structure-prediction techniques is made. SPINE X predicts number of helices and sheets correctly for 21.0{\%} of 1833 proteins, compared to 17.6{\%} by PSIPRED. It further shows that SPINE X consistently makes more accurate prediction in helical residues (6{\%}) without over prediction while PSIPRED makes more accurate prediction in coil residues (3-5{\%}) and over predicts them by 7{\%}.

Understanding the emergence of novel protein folds is an important step towards understanding the rules governing the evolution of protein structure and function and for developing tools for protein structure modeling and design. We explored the frequency of occurrences of an exhaustively classified library of supersecondary structural elements (Smotifs), in protein structures, in order to identify features that would define a fold as novel compared to previously known structures. We found that a surprisingly small set of Smotifs is sufficient to describe all known folds. Furthermore, novel folds do not require novel Smotifs, but rather are a new combination of existing ones. Novel folds can be typified by the inclusion of a relatively higher number of rarely occurring Smotifs in their structures and, to a lesser extent, by a novel topological combination of commonly occurring Smotifs. When investigating the structural features of Smotifs, we found that the top 10{\%} of most frequent ones have a higher fraction of internal contacts, while some of the most rare motifs are larger, and contain a longer loop region.},

abstract = {This work presents a method to portray protein folding dynamics at a coarse resolution, based on a pattern-recognition-and-feedback description of the evolution of torsional motions of the backbone chain in the hydrophobic collapse of the protein. The approach permits theory and computation to treat the search of conformation space from picoseconds to the millisecond time scale or longer, the time scales of adiabatic evolution of soft-mode dynamics. The procedure tracks the backbone torsional coordinates modulo the basins of attraction to which they belong in the Ramachandran maps. The state and history of the backbone are represented in a map of local torsional states and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity matching of the residues comprising the chain, the local topology matrix (LTM). From this map, we infer allowable structural features by recognizing patterns in the LTM as topologically compatible with particular structural forms within a level of frustration tolerance. Each such 3D realization of an LTM leads to a contact map, from which one can infer one or more structures. Introduction of energetic and entropic terms allow elimination of all but the most favored of these structures at each new juncture. The method's predictive power is first established by comparing "final," stable LTMs for natural sequences of intermediate length (N less than or equal to 120) with PDB data. The method is extended further to beta -lactoglobulin (beta -LG, N=162), the quintessential nonhierarchical folder.},

abstract = {The kinetic folding of ribonuclease H was studied by hydrogen exchange (HX) pulse labeling with analysis by an advanced fragment separation mass spectrometry technology. The results show that folding proceeds through distinct intermediates in a stepwise pathway that sequentially incorporates cooperative native-like structural elements to build the native protein. Each step is seen as a concerted transition of one or more segments from an HX-unprotected to an HX-protected state. Deconvolution of the data to near amino acid resolution shows that each step corresponds to the folding of a secondary structural element of the native protein, termed a "foldon." Each folded segment is retained through subsequent steps of foldon addition, revealing a stepwise buildup of the native structure via a single dominant pathway. Analysis of the pertinent literature suggests that this model is consistent with experimental results for many proteins and some current theoretical results. Two biophysical principles appear to dictate this behavior. The principle of cooperativity determines the central role of native-like foldon units. An interaction principle termed "sequential stabilization" based on native-like interfoldon interactions orders the pathway.},

Each sector is physically connected in the tertiary structure, has a distinct functional role, and constitutes an independent mode of sequence divergence in the protein family.

abstract = {With growing amount of experimental data, the number of known protein structures also increases continuously. Classification of protein structures helps to understand relationships between protein structure and function. The main classification methods based on secondary structures are SCOP, CATH and TOPS, which all classify under different aspects, and therefore can lead to different results. We developed a mathematically unique representation of protein structure topologies at a higher abstraction level providing new aspects of classification and enabling for a fast search through the data. Protein Topology Graph Library (PTGL; http://ptgl.zib.de) aims at providing a database on protein secondary structure topologies, including search facilities, the visualization as intuitive topology diagrams as well as in the 3D structure, and additional information. Secondary structure-based protein topologies are represented uniquely as undirected labeled graphs in four different ways allowing for exploration under different aspects. The linear notations, and the 2D and 3D diagrams of each notation facilitate a deeper understanding of protein topologies.

abstract = {Methods predicting protein secondary structure improved substantially in the 1990s through the use of evolutionary information taken from the divergence of proteins in the same structural family. Recently, the evolutionary information resulting from improved searches and larger databases has again boosted prediction accuracy by more than four percentage points to its current height of around 76{\%} of all residues predicted correctly in one of the three states, helix, strand, and other. The past year also brought successful new concepts to the field. These new methods may be particularly interesting in light of the improvements achieved through simple combining of existing methods. Divergent evolutionary profiles contain enough information not only to substantially improve prediction accuracy, but also to correctly predict long stretches of identical residues observed in alternative secondary structure states depending on nonlocal conditions. An example is a method automatically identifying structural switches and thus finding a remarkable connection between predicted secondary structure and aspects of function. Secondary structure predictions are increasingly becoming the work horse for numerous methods aimed at predicting protein structure and function. Is the recent increase in accuracy significant enough to make predictions even more useful? Because the recent improvement yields a better prediction of segments, and in particular of beta strands, I believe the answer is affirmative. What is the limit of prediction accuracy? We shall see.},

Does the observed helicity require a new explanation, or is it consistent with previous understanding? In this work we show that this helicity is consistent with the physical theory of secondary structure based on an extension of the conventional Zimm-Bragg model. Without any special modifications, this theory explains reasonably well almost all the experimentally observed dependencies of helicity on pH, temperature, and amino acid replacements. We conclude that the observed "general level" of helicity of C- and S-peptides (5-30{\%} at room temperature and 10-50{\%} near 0 degrees C) is "normal" for short peptides consisting mainly of helix-forming and helix-indifferent residues. The helicity is modified by a multitude of weak specific side chain interactions, many of which are taken into account by the present theory; some discrepancies between the theory and experiment can be explained by weak side-chain-side chain interactions that were neglected. A reasonable coincidence of the theory with experiment suggests that it had been used to investigate the role of local interactions in the formation of alpha-helical "embryos" in unfolded protein chains.},

We found that a central residue in a helical peptide cannot adopt dihedral angles from strand regions without encountering a steric collision. Consequently, an alpha-helical segment followed by a beta-strand segment must be connected by an intervening linker. This restriction was validated both by simulations and by seeking violations within proteins of known structure. In fact, no violations were found within an extensive database of high-resolution X-ray structures. Nature's exclusion of alpha-beta hybrid segments, fashioned from an alpha-helix adjoined to a beta-strand, is built into proteins at the covalent level. This straightforward conformational constraint has far-reaching consequences in organizing unfolded proteins and limiting the number of possible protein domains.},

It has been a long-standing open question whether such information is sufficient to determine a protein's fold. Indeed, even the far simpler problem of reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its exact backbone torsion angles has remained a difficult challenge owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, cause large errors in structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm; the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Here, correct secondary structure assignments (alpha-helix, beta-strand, beta-turn, polyproline II, coil) were used to constrain polypeptide backbone chains devoid of side chains, and the most stable folded conformations were determined, using Monte Carlo simulation. Just three terms were used to assess stability: molecular compaction, steric exclusion, and hydrogen bonding. For nine of the 13 proteins, this protocol restricts the main chain to a surprisingly small number of energetically favorable topologies, with the native one prominent among them.},

abstract = {Finding structural similarities between proteins often helps reveal shared functionality, which otherwise might not be detected by native sequence information alone. Such similarity is usually detected and quantified by protein structure alignment. Determining the optimal alignment between two protein structures, however, remains a hard problem. An alternative approach is to approximate each three-dimensional protein structure using a sequence of motifs derived from a structural alphabet. Using this approach, structure comparison is performed by comparing the corresponding motif sequences or structural sequences. In this article, we measure the performance of such alphabets in the context of the protein structure classification problem. We consider both local and global structural sequences. Each letter of a local structural sequence corresponds to the best matching fragment to the corresponding local segment of the protein structure. The global structural sequence is designed to generate the best possible complete chain that matches the full protein structure. We use an alphabet of 20 letters, corresponding to a library of 20 motifs or protein fragments having four residues. We show that the global structural sequences approximate well the native structures of proteins, with an average coordinate root mean square of 0.69???? over 2225 test proteins. The approximation is best for all ??-proteins, while relatively poorer for all ??-proteins. We then test the performance of four different sequence representations of proteins (their native sequence, the sequence of their secondary-structure elements, and the local and global structural sequences based on our fragment library) with different classifiers in their ability to classify proteins that belong to five distinct folds of CATH. Without surprise, the primary sequence alone performs poorly as a structure classifier. We show that addition of either secondary-structure information or local information from the structural sequence considerably improves the classification accuracy. The two fragment-based sequences perform better than the secondary-structure sequence but not well enough at this stage to be a viable alternative to more computationally intensive methods based on protein structure alignment. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Results of this analysis showed that these proteins do not possess uniform structural properties, as expected for members of a single thermodynamic entity. Rather, these proteins may be divided into two structurally different groups: intrinsic coils, and premolten globules. Proteins from the first group have hydrodynamic dimensions typical of random coils in poor solvent and do not possess any (or almost any) ordered secondary structure. Proteins from the second group are essentially more compact, exhibiting some amount of residual secondary structure, although they are still less dense than native or molten globule proteins. An important feature of the intrinsically unstructured proteins is that they undergo disorder-order transition during or prior to their biological function. In this respect, the Protein Quartet model, with function arising from four specific conformations (ordered forms, molten globules, premolten globules, and random coils) and transitions between any two of the states, is discussed},

The goal of this study was to summarize the structural information on natively unfolded proteins in order to evaluate their major conformational characteristics. It appeared that natively unfolded proteins are characterized by low overall hydrophobicity and large net charge. They possess hydrodynamic properties typical of random coils in poor solvent, or premolten globule conformation. These proteins show a low level of ordered secondary structure and no tightly packed core. They are very flexible, but may adopt relatively rigid conformations in the presence of natural ligands. Finally, in comparison with the globular proteins, natively unfolded polypeptides possess 'turn out' responses to changes in the environment, as their structural complexities increase at high temperature or at extreme pH.},

Structure evolution information is encoded into profiles using structural features, such as solvent accessibility and local conformation —with Protein Blocks—, which give an accurate description of the local protein structure. ORION has recently been improved, increasing by 5{\%} the quality of its results. The ORION web server accepts a single protein sequence as input and searches homologous protein structures within minutes.

Reducing alphabet cardinality without losing key biochemical information opens the door to potentially faster machine learning, data mining and optimization applications in structural bioinformatics. Furthermore, reduced but informative alphabets often result in, e.g., more compact and human-friendly classification/clustering rules. In this paper we propose a robust and sophisticated alphabet reduction protocol based on mutual information and state-of-the-art optimization techniques.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We applied this protocol to the prediction of two protein structural features: contact number and relative solvent accessibility. For both features we generated alphabets of two, three, four and five letters. The five-letter alphabets gave prediction accuracies statistically similar to that obtained using the full amino acid alphabet. Moreover, the automatically designed alphabets were compared against other reduced alphabets taken from the literature or human-designed, outperforming them. The differences between our alphabets and the alphabets taken from the literature were quantitatively analyzed. All the above process had been performed using a primary sequence representation of proteins. As a final experiment, we extrapolated the obtained five-letter alphabet to reduce a, much richer, protein representation based on evolutionary information for the prediction of the same two features. Again, the performance gap between the full representation and the reduced representation was small, showing that the results of our automated alphabet reduction protocol, even if they were obtained using a simple representation, are also able to capture the crucial information needed for state-of-the-art protein representations.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Our automated alphabet reduction protocol generates competent reduced alphabets tailored specifically for a variety of protein datasets. This process is done without any domain knowledge, using information theory metrics instead. The reduced alphabets contain some unexpected (but sound) groups of amino acids, thus suggesting new ways of interpreting the data.},

In contrast, the apolar core of a biological membrane seems like an ideal environment for hydrogen bonds, and it has long been assumed that hydrogen bonding should be a powerful force driving membrane protein folding. Nevertheless, while backbone hydrogen bonds may be much stronger in membrane proteins, experimental measurements indicate that side chain hydrogen bond strengths are not strikingly different in membrane and water soluble proteins. How is this possible? I argue that model compounds in apolar solvents do not adequately describe the system because the protein itself is ignored. The protein chain provides a rich source of competitive hydrogen bonds and a polarizable environment that can weaken hydrogen bonds. Thus, just like water soluble proteins, evolution can drive the creation of potent hydrogen bonds in membrane proteins where necessary, but mitigating forces in their environment must still be overcome. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Empirical criteria for identification of hydrogen bonds were analyzed to produce a set of geometrically consistent criteria. For a data set of 30 structures, application of a set of purely geometrical criteria, along with exclusion of abnormal backbone conformations, also excluded a com-mon interaction of Ser/Thr side chains with Asp/Glu side chains ([ST]/[DE] pairs). These interactions were termed 'bifurcated hydrogen bonds', which implies delocalization of a positively charged hydrogen of hydroxyl between the two acceptor atoms of the carboxylic group. These 'bifurcated' interactions are among the most common packing patterns for [ST]/[DE] pairs of side chains. There-fore, the identification of hydrogen bonds cannot be based on geometrical criteria only and requires introduction of some physico-chemical criteria.},

abstract = {Protein structures are valuable tools to understand protein function. Nonetheless, proteins are often considered as rigid macromolecules while their structures exhibit specific flexibility, which is essential to complete their functions. Analyses of protein structures and dynamics are often performed with a simplified three-state description, i.e., the classical secondary structures. More precise and complete description of protein backbone conformation can be obtained using libraries of small protein fragments that are able to approximate every part of protein structures. These libraries, called structural alphabets (SAs), have been widely used in structure analysis field, from definition of ligand binding sites to superimposition of protein structures. SAs are also well suited to analyze the dynamics of protein structures. Here, we review innovative approaches that investigate protein flexibility based on SAs description. Coupled to various sources of experimental data (e.g., B-factor) and computational methodology (e.g., Molecular Dynamic simulation), SAs turn out to be powerful tools to analyze protein dynamics, e.g., to examine allosteric mechanisms in large set of structures in complexes, to identify order/disorder transition. SAs were also shown to be quite efficient to predict protein flexibility from amino-acid sequence. Finally, in this review, we exemplify the interest of SAs for studying flexibility with different cases of proteins implicated in pathologies and diseases.},

This paper reviews physics-based models of binding, beginning with a summary of the changes in potential energy, solvation energy, and configurational entropy that influence affinity, and a theoretical overview to frame the discussion of specific computational approaches. Important advances are reported in modeling protein-ligand energetics, such as the incorporation of electronic polarization and the use of quantum mechanical methods. Recent calculations suggest that changes in configurational entropy strongly oppose binding and must be included if accurate affinities are to be obtained. The linear interaction energy (LIE) and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) methods are analyzed, as are free energy pathway methods, which show promise and may be ready for more extensive testing. Ultimately, major improvements in modeling accuracy will likely require advances on multiple fronts, as well as continued validation against experiment.},

abstract = {Reconstructing a protein in three dimensions from its backbone torsion angles is an ongoing challenge because minor inaccuracies in these angles produce major errors in the structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm, the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Even accurate knowledge of the backbone torsions and Psi is insufficient, owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, also lead to major errors in the structure. Against this background, we conducted a computational experiment to assess whether protein conformation can be determined from highly approximate backbone torsion angles, the kind of information that is now obtained readily from NMR. Specifically, backbone torsion angles were taken from proteins of known structure and mapped into 60 degrees x 60 degrees grid squares, called mesostates. Side-chain atoms beyond the beta -carbon were discarded. A mesostate representation of the protein backbone was then used to extract likely candidates from a fragment library of mesostate pentamers, followed by Monte Carlo-based fragment-assembly simulations to identify stable conformations compatible with the given mesostate sequence. Only three simple energy terms were used to gauge stability: molecular compaction, soft-sphere repulsion, and hydrogen bonding. For the six representative proteins described here, stable conformers can be partitioned into a remarkably small number of topologically distinct clusters. Among these, the native topology is found with high frequency and can be identified as the cluster with the most favorable energy.},

abstract = {Many single-domain proteins exhibit two-state folding kinetics, with folding rates that span more than six orders of magnitude. A quantity of much recent interest for such proteins is their contact order, the average separation in sequence between contacting residue pairs. Numerous studies have reached the surprising conclusion that contact order is well-correlated with the logarithm of the folding rate for these small, well-characterized molecules. Here, we investigate the physico-chemical basis for this finding by asking whether contact order is actually a composite number that measures the fraction of local secondary structure in the protein; viz. turns, helices, and hairpins. To pursue this question, we calculated the secondary structure content for 24 two-state proteins and obtained coefficients that predict their folding rates. The predicted rates correlate strongly with experimentally determined rates, comparable to the correlation with contact order. Further, these predicted folding rates are correlated strongly with contact order. Our results suggest that the folding rate of two-state proteins is a function of their local secondary structure content, consistent with the hierarchic model of protein folding. Accordingly, it should be possible to utilize secondary structure prediction methods to predict folding rates from sequence alone. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To answer this question, we measure the entropy densities of primary and secondary structure sequences, and the local inter-sequence mutual information density. RESULTS: We find that the important inter-sequence interactions are short ranged, that correlations between neighboring amino acids are essentially uninformative and that only one-fourth of the total information needed to determine the secondary structure is available from local inter-sequence correlations. These observations support the view that the majority of most proteins fold via a cooperative process where secondary and tertiary structure form concurrently. Moreover, existing single-sequence secondary structure prediction algorithms are almost optimal, and we should not expect a dramatic improvement in prediction accuracy.

Remarkably, in the designed sequences 51{\%} of the core residues and 27{\%} of all residues were identical to the amino acids in the corresponding positions in the native sequences. The lowest free energy sequences obtained for ensembles of native-like backbone structures were also similar to the native sequence. Furthermore, both the individual residue frequencies and the covariances between pairs of positions observed in the very large SH3 domain family were recapitulated in core sequences designed for SH3 domain structures.

abstract = {A recent article in this journal (Ioannidis JP (2005) Why most published research findings are false. PLoS Med 2: e124) argued that more than half of published research findings in the medical literature are false. In this commentary, we examine the structure of that argument, and show that it has three basic components: 1)An assumption that the prior probability of most hypotheses explored in medical research is below 50{\%}. 2)Dichotomization of P-values at the 0.05 level and introduction of a bias factor (produced by significance-seeking), the combination of which severely weakens the evidence provided by every design. 3)Use of Bayes theorem to show that, in the face of weak evidence, hypotheses with low prior probabilities cannot have posterior probabilities over 50{\%}. Thus, the claim is based on a priori assumptions that most tested hypotheses are likely to be false, and then the inferential model used makes it impossible for evidence from any study to overcome this handicap. We focus largely on step (2), explaining how the combination of dichotomization and bias dilutes experimental evidence, and showing how this dilution leads inevitably to the stated conclusion. We also demonstrate a fallacy in another important component of the argument that papers in hot fields are more likely to produce false findings. We agree with the papers conclusions and recommendations that many medical research findings are less definitive than readers suspect, that P-values are widely misinterpreted, that bias of various forms is widespread, that multiple approaches are needed to prevent the literature from being systematically biased and the need for more data on the prevalence of false claims. But calculating the unreliability of the medical research literature, in whole or in part, requires more empirical evidence and different inferential models than were used. The claim that most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields must be considered as yet unproven.},

We show that transition paths follow a predictable sequence of high-free-energy transient states that are separated by free-energy barriers. Each transient state corresponds to the assembly of one or more discrete, cooperative units, which are determined directly from the native structure. We show that the transition state on a folding pathway is reached when a small number of critical contacts are formed between a specific set of substructures, after which folding proceeds downhill in free energy. This approach suggests a natural resolution for distinguishing parallel folding pathways and provides a simple means to predict the rate-limiting step in a folding reaction. Our theory identifies a common folding mechanism for proteins with diverse native structures and establishes general principles for the self-assembly of polymers with specific interactions.},

abstract = {The ability to predict protein structures from gene sequence data through computational means has significant implications in the fields of computational chemistry, structural biology and medicinal chemistry, as well as in expanding the impact of the research on the human genome. Current challenges for this task, also known as ab-initio protein structure prediction, include validity of the available molecular models and complexity of the search space. A novel four stage ab-initio approach for the structure prediction of single chain polypeptides is introduced. The methodology combines the classical and new views of protein folding, while using free energy calculations and integer linear optimization to predict helical and $\beta$-sheet structures. Detailed atomistic modeling and the deterministic global optimization method, $\alpha$BB, coupled with torsion angle dynamics, form the basis for the final tertiary structure prediction. The excellent performance of the proposed approach is illustrated using the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein.},

@article{Hunt1994,
abstract = {Globular proteins fold to create compact structures rich in alpha-helices and beta-sheets. While studies of cubic lattice models of simplified polypeptide chains have concluded that secondary structure is a necessary consequence of chain compactness, different conclusions have been reached from studies of off-lattice models of simplified chains. In an attempt to resolve this controversy, we study an all-atom off-lattice model of a protein subject to a variety of simplified energy functions. A Monte Carlo simulated annealing algorithm is used to search conformational space quickly. The algorithm uses pivot-type moves in which a residue is selected at random and the values of its main-chain dihedral angles are changed. The energy function used to accept or reject moves is taken to be either a term proportional to the volume occupied by a structure (to mimic the hydrophobic effect), a term proportional to the energy of main-chain hydrogen bonding, or a combination of these two terms. Secondary structure content is evaluated using several different definitions. For all the definitions used, compactness alone produces a 10{\%} increase in secondary structure content. However, this is a small fraction of the secondary structure observed in native protein structures. Structures produced by minimizing the hydrogen bond energy have extensive secondary structure but are not densely packed. Structures having both the high density of native structures and extensive secondary structure are produced by minimizing combinations of the volume and hydrogen bond energy terms. Our results emphasize the close relationship between secondary structure and the geometry of main-chain hydrogen bonding. The results are consistent with a description of protein folding in which the hydrophobic effect favors dense packing while hydrogen bonding determines the specific local geometry which generates secondary structure. To make an analogy with lattice studies of packing density and secondary structure, it seems that hydrophobicity provides the packing density while hydrogen bonding provides the lattice.},

@article{Hu2013c,
abstract = {The kinetic folding of ribonuclease H was studied by hydrogen exchange (HX) pulse labeling with analysis by an advanced fragment separation mass spectrometry technology. The results show that folding proceeds through distinct intermediates in a stepwise pathway that sequentially incorporates cooperative native-like structural elements to build the native protein. Each step is seen as a concerted transition of one or more segments from an HX-unprotected to an HX-protected state. Deconvolution of the data to near amino acid resolution shows that each step corresponds to the folding of a secondary structural element of the native protein, termed a "foldon." Each folded segment is retained through subsequent steps of foldon addition, revealing a stepwise buildup of the native structure via a single dominant pathway. Analysis of the pertinent literature suggests that this model is consistent with experimental results for many proteins and some current theoretical results. Two biophysical principles appear to dictate this behavior. The principle of cooperativity determines the central role of native-like foldon units. An interaction principle termed "sequential stabilization" based on native-like interfoldon interactions orders the pathway.},

According to this model, our group proposed a three-stage scheme for a feasible time-wise semi ab-intio protein structure prediction. Given a protein sequence, at the first stage of the prediction scheme, we propose cutting the sequence into structurally assigned BBs. Next, we perform a combinatorial assembly and attempt to predict the relative three-dimensional arrangement of the BBs. In the third stage, we refine and rank the assemblies. The scheme has proven to be very promising in reducing the complexity of the protein folding problem and gaining insight into the protein folding process. In this chapter, we describe the different stages of the scheme and discuss a possible application of the model to protein design.},

Despite intense investigation, predictive understanding of helices is still lacking. A recent hypothesis [Presta, L. G., {\&} Rose, G. D. (1988) Science 240, 1632-1641] proposed that the structural specificity of helices resides, in part, in those residues that flank helix termini. If so, then signals that arrest helix propagation--i.e., helix stop signals--should be found among these flanking residues. Evidence is presented for the existence of one such signal, a reciprocal backbone-side-chain hydrogen-bonding interaction, dubbed the capping box. In proteins, the capping box is found uniquely at helix N-termini. In peptides, the capping box can function as a helix stop signal, as shown in the work of Kallenbach and co-workers.},

abstract = {Biological processes are the result of noncovalent, protein-ligand interactions, where the ligands range from small organic and inorganic molecules to lipids, nucleic acids, peptides, and proteins. Amide groups within proteins constantly exchange protons with water. When immersed in heavy water (D2O), mass spectrometry (MS) can measure the change of mass associated with the hydrogen to deuterium exchange (HDX). Protein-ligand interactions modify the hydrogen exchange rates of amide protons, and the measurement of the amide exchange rates can provide rich information regarding the dynamical structure of the protein-ligand complex. This chapter describes a protocol for conducting bottom-up, continuous uptake, proteolytic fragmentation HDX-MS experiments that can help identify and map the interacting peptides of a protein-ligand interface. This tutorial outlines the fundamental theory governing hydrogen exchange; provides practical information regarding the preparation of protein samples and solutions; and describes the exchange reaction, reaction quenching, enzymatic digestion, chromatographic separation, and peptide analysis by MS. Tables list representative combinations of fluidic components used by HDX-MS researchers and summarize the available HDX-MS analysis software packages. Additionally, two HDX-MS case studies are used to illustrate protein-ligand interactions involving: (1) a continuous sequence of interacting residues and (2) a set of discontinuously numbered residues, residing spatially near each other.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Sequence alignment techniques have been developed into extremely powerful tools for identifying the folding families and function of proteins in newly sequenced genomes. For a sufficiently low sequence identity it is necessary to incorporate additional structural information to positively detect homologous proteins. We have carried out an extensive analysis of the effectiveness of incorporating secondary structure information directly into the alignments for fold recognition and identification of distant protein homologs. A secondary structure similarity matrix based on a database of three-dimensionally aligned proteins was first constructed. An iterative application of dynamic programming was used which incorporates linear combinations of amino acid and secondary structure sequence similarity scores. Initially, only primary sequence information is used. Subsequently contributions from secondary structure are phased in and new homologous proteins are positively identified if their scores are consistent with the predetermined error rate. RESULTS We used the SCOP40 database, where only PDB sequences that have 40{\%} homology or less are included, to calibrate homology detection by the combined amino acid and secondary structure sequence alignments. Combining predicted secondary structure with sequence information results in a 8-15{\%} increase in homology detection within SCOP40 relative to the pairwise alignments using only amino acid sequence data at an error rate of 0.01 errors per query; a 35{\%} increase is observed when the actual secondary structure sequences are used. Incorporating predicted secondary structure information in the analysis of six small genomes yields an improvement in the homology detection of approximately 20{\%} over SSEARCH pairwise alignments, but no improvement in the total number of homologs detected over PSI-BLAST, at an error rate of 0.01 errors per query. However, because the pairwise alignments based on combinations of amino acid and secondary structure similarity are different from those produced by PSI-BLAST and the error rates can be calibrated, it is possible to combine the results of both searches. An additional 25{\%} relative improvement in the number of genes identified at an error rate of 0.01 is observed when the data is pooled in this way. Similarly for the SCOP40 dataset, PSI-BLAST detected 15{\%} of all possible homologs, whereas the pooled results increased the total number of homologs detected to 19{\%}. These results are compared with recent reports of homology detection using sequence profiling methods.

abstract = {In this study we present an accurate secondary structure prediction procedure by using an query and related sequences. The most novel aspect of our approach is its reliance on local pairwise alignment of the sequence to be predicted with each related sequence rather than utilization of a multiple alignment. The residue-by-residue accuracy of the method is 75{\%} in three structural states after jack-knife tests. The gain in prediction accuracy compared with the existing techniques, which are at best 72{\%}, is achieved by secondary structure propensities based on both local and long-range effects, utilization of similar sequence information in the form of carefully selected pairwise alignment fragments, and reliance on a large collection of known protein primary structures. The method is especially appropriate for large-scale sequence analysis of efforts such as genome characterization, where precise and significant multiple sequence alignments are not available or achievable.},

@article{Creamer1992a,
abstract = {In recent host-guest studies, the helix-forming tendencies of amino acid residues have been quantified by three groups, each obtaining similar results [Padmanabhan, S., Marqusee, S., Ridgeway, T., Laue, T. M. {\&} Baldwin, R. L. (1990) Nature (London) 344, 268-270; O'Neil, K. T. {\&} DeGrado, W. F. (1990) Science 250, 646-651; Lyu, P. C., Liff, M. I., Marky, L. A. {\&} Kallenbach, N. R. (1990) Science 250, 669-673]. Here, we explore the hypothesis that these measured helix-forming propensities are due primarily to conformational restrictions imposed upon residue side chains by the helix itself. This proposition is tested by calculating the extent to which the bulky helix backbone "freezes out" available degrees of freedom in helix side chains. Specifically, for a series of apolar residues, the difference in configurational entropy, delta S, between each side chain in the unfolded state and in the alpha-helical state is obtained from a simple Monte Carlo calculation. These computed entropy differences are then compared with the experimentally determined values. Measured and calculated values are found to be in close agreement for naturally occurring amino acids and in total disagreement for non-natural amino acids. In the calculation, delta S(Ala) = 0. The rank order of entropy loss for the series of natural apolar side chains under consideration is Ala less than Leu less than Trp less than Met less than Phe less than Ile less than Tyr less than Val. Among these, none favor helix formation; Ala is neutral, and all remaining residues are unfavorable to varying degrees. Thus, applied to side chains, the term "helix preference" is a misnomer. While side chain-side chain interactions may modulate stability in some instances, our results indicate that the drive to form helices must originate in the backbone, consistent with Pauling's view of four decades ago [Pauling, L., Corey, R. B. {\&} Branson, H. R. (1951) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 37, 205-210].},

abstract = {Accurate assignments of secondary structures in proteins are crucial for a useful comparison with theoretical predictions. Three major programs which automatically determine the location of helices and strands are used for this purpose, namely DSSP, P-Curve and Define. Their results have been compared for a non-redundant database of 154 proteins. On a residue per residue basis, the percentage match score is only 63{\%} between the three methods. While these methods agree on the overall number of residues in each of the three states (helix, strand or coil), they differ on the number of helices or strands, thus implying a wide discrepancy in the length of assigned structural elements. Moreover, the length distribution of helices and strands points to the existence of artefacts inherent to each assignment algorithm. To overcome these difficulties a consensus assignment is proposed where each residue is assigned to the state determined by at least two of the three methods. With this assignment the artefacts of each algorithm are attenuated. The residues assigned in the same state by the three methods are better predicted than the others. This assignment will thus be useful for analysing the success rate of prediction methods more accurately.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Surprisingly, Cys{\_}SH residues display stronger hydrophobicity than Cys{\_}SS residues. A detailed survey of atoms which come into contact with the sulfhydryl group (sulfur atom) of Cys{\_}SH revealed those atoms are essentially the same in number and variety as those of the methyl group of isoleucine, but are quite different to those of the hydroxyl group of serine. Moreover, the relationships among amino acids were also determined using the 3D-profile table of known protein structures. Cys{\_}SH was located in the hydrophobic cluster, along with residues such as Met, Trp and Tyr, and was clearly separated from Ser and Thr in the polar cluster. These results imply that free cysteines behave as strongly hydrophobic, and not hydrophilic, residues in proteins.},

abstract = {We analyzed the total, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic accessible surfaces (ASAs) of residues from a nonredundant bank of 587 3D structure proteins. In an extended fold, residues are classified into three families with respect to their hydrophobicity balance. As expected, residues lose part of their solvent-accessible surface with folding but the three groups remain. The decrease of accessibility is more pronounced for hydrophobic than hydrophilic residues. Amazingly, Lysine is the residue with the largest hydrophobic accessible surface in folded structures. Our analysis points out a clear difference between the mean (other studies) and median (this study) ASA values of hydrophobic residues, which should be taken into consideration for future investigations on a protein-accessible surface, in order to improve predictions requiring ASA values. The different secondary structures correspond to different accessibility of residues. Random coils, turns, and beta-structures (outside beta-sheets) are the most accessible folds, with an average of 30{\%} accessibility. The helical residues are about 20{\%} accessible, and the difference between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic residues illustrates the amphipathy of many helices. Residues from beta-sheets are the most inaccessible to solvent (10{\%} accessible). Hence, beta-sheets are the most appropriate structures to shield the hydrophobic parts of residues from water. We also show that there is an equal balance between the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic accessible surfaces of the 3D protein surfaces irrespective of the protein size. This results in a patchwork surface of hydrophobic and hydrophilic areas, which could be important for protein interactions and/or activity.},

abstract = {The relative solvent accessibility (RSA) of a residue in a protein measures the extent of burial or exposure of that residue in the 3D structure. RSA is frequently used to describe a protein's biophysical or evolutionary properties. To calculate RSA, a residue's solvent accessibility (ASA) needs to be normalized by a suitable reference value for the given amino acid; several normalization scales have previously been proposed. However, these scales do not provide tight upper bounds on ASA values frequently observed in empirical crystal structures. Instead, they underestimate the largest allowed ASA values, by up to 20{\%}. As a result, many empirical crystal structures contain residues that seem to have RSA values in excess of one. Here, we derive a new normalization scale that does provide a tight upper bound on observed ASA values. We pursue two complementary strategies, one based on extensive analysis of empirical structures and one based on systematic enumeration of biophysically allowed tripeptides. Both approaches yield congruent results that consistently exceed published values. We conclude that previously published ASA normalization values were too small, primarily because the conformations that maximize ASA had not been correctly identified. As an application of our results, we show that empirically derived hydrophobicity scales are sensitive to accurate RSA calculation, and we derive new hydrophobicity scales that show increased correlation with experimentally measured scales.},

We have calculated the mean area buried upon folding for every chemical group in each residue within a set of X-ray elucidated proteins. These measurements, together with a standard state cavity size for each group, are documented in a table. It is observed that, on average, each type of group buries a constant fraction of its standard state area. The mean area buried by most, though not all, groups can be closely approximated by summing contributions from three characteristic parameters corresponding to three atom types: (1) carbon or sulfur, which turn out to be 86{\%} buried, on average; (2) neutral oxygen or nitrogen, which are 40{\%} buried, on average; and (3) charged oxygen or nitrogen, which are 32{\%} buried, on average.},

abstract = {Hydrophobicity is thought to be one of the primary forces driving the folding of proteins. On average, hydrophobic residues occur preferentially in the core, whereas polar residues tend to occur at the surface of a folded protein. By analyzing the known protein structures, we quantify the degree to which the hydrophobicity sequence of a protein correlates with its pattern of surface exposure. We have assessed the statistical significance of this correlation for several hydrophobicity scales in the literature, and find that the computed correlations are significant but far from optimal. We show that this less than optimal correlation arises primarily from the large degree of mutations that naturally occurring proteins can tolerate. Lesser effects are due in part to forces other than hydrophobicity, and we quantify this by analyzing the surface-exposure distributions of all amino acids. Lastly, we show that our database findings are consistent with those found from an off-lattice hydrophobic-polar model of protein folding.},

Solvent accessibility is a simple model that distinguishes residue environment. The pairwise interactions represent a simple model of local side chain to side chain interactions. To test the importance of these features we developed an algorithm to separate alpha-helices, beta-strands, and "other" structure. Single residue and pairwise probabilities were determined for 25,141 samples from proteins with {\textless}30{\%} homology. Combining the features of solvent accessibility with pairwise probabilities allows us to distinguish the three structures after cross validation at the 82.0{\%} level. We gain 1.4{\%} to 2.0{\%} accuracy by optimizing the propensities, demonstrating that probabilities do not necessarily reflect propensities. Optimization of residue exposures, weights of all probabilities, and propensities increased accuracy to 84.0{\%}.},

@article{Minh2015,
abstract = {A binding potential of mean force (BPMF) is a free energy of noncovalent association in which one binding partner is flexible and the other is rigid. I have developed a method to calculate BPMFs for protein-ligand systems. The method is based on replica exchange sampling from multiple thermodynamic states at different temperatures and protein-ligand interaction strengths. Protein-ligand interactions are represented by interpolating precomputed electrostatic and van der Waals grids. Using a simple estimator for thermodynamic length, thermodynamic states are initialized at approximately equal intervals. The method is demonstrated on the Astex diverse set, a database of 85 protein-ligand complexes relevant to pharmacy or agriculture. Fifteen independent simulations of each complex were started using poses from crystallography, docking, or the lowest-energy pose observed in the other simulations. Benchmark simulations completed within three days on a single processor. Overall, protocols initialized using the thermodynamic length estimator were system-specific, robust, and led to approximately even replica exchange acceptance probabilities between neighboring states. In most systems, the standard deviation of the BPMF converges to within 5 kT. Even with low variance, however, the mean BPMF was sometimes dependent on starting conditions, implying inadequate sampling. Within the thermodynamic cycle, free energies estimated based on multiple intermediate states were more precise, and those estimated by single-step perturbation were less precise. The results demonstrate that the method is promising, but that ligand pose sampling and phase space overlap can sometimes prevent precise BPMF estimation. The software used to perform these calculations, Alchemical Grid Dock (AlGDock), is available under the open-source MIT license at https://github.com/ccbatiit/algdock/.},

abstract = {The structural and dynamical properties of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) nuclear receptor have been broadly studied in its agonist state but little is known about the key features required for the receptor antagonistic activity. Here we report a series of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in combination with free energy estimation of the recently discovered class of non-covalent PPAR$\gamma$ antagonists. Their binding modes and dynamical behavior are described in details. Two key interactions have been detected within the cavity between helices H3, H11 and the activation helix H12, as well as with H12. The strength of the ligand-amino acid residues interactions has been analyzed in relation to the specificity of the ligand dynamical and antagonistic features. According to our results, the PPAR$\gamma$ activation helix does not undergo dramatic conformational changes, as seen in other nuclear receptors, but rather perturbations that occur through a significant ligand-induced reshaping of the ligand-receptor and the receptor-coactivator binding pockets. The H12 residue Tyr473 and the charge clamp residue Glu471 play a central role for the receptor transformations. Our results also demonstrate that MD can be a helpful tool for the compound phenotype characterization (full agonists, partial agonists or antagonists) when insufficient experimental data are available.},

abstract = {During biosynthesis, a globular protein folds into a tight particle with an interior core that is shielded from the surrounding solvent. The hydrophobic effect is thought to play a key role in mediating this process: nonpolar residues expelled from water engender a molecular interior where they can be buried. Paradoxically, results of earlier quantitative analyses have suggested that the tendency for nonpolar residues to be buried within proteins is weak. However, such analyses merely classify residues as either "exposed" or "buried." In the experiment reported in this article proteins of known structure were used to measure the average area that each residue buries upon folding. This characteristic quantity, the average area buried, is correlated with residue hydrophobicity.},

abstract = {The human proteome contains a plethora of short linear motifs (SLiMs) that serve as binding interfaces for modular protein domains. Such interactions are crucial for signaling and other cellular processes, but are difficult to detect because of their low to moderate affinities. Here we developed a dedicated approach, proteomic peptide-phage display (ProP-PD), to identify domain-SLiM interactions. Specifically, we generated phage libraries containing all human and viral C-terminal peptides using custom oligonucleotide microarrays. With these libraries we screened the nine PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains of human Densin-180, Erbin, Scribble, and Disks large homolog 1 for peptide ligands. We identified several known and putative interactions potentially relevant to cellular signaling pathways and confirmed interactions between full-length Scribble and the target proteins $\beta$-PIX, plakophilin-4, and guanylate cyclase soluble subunit $\alpha$-2 using colocalization and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The affinities of recombinant Scribble PDZ domains and the synthetic peptides representing the C termini of these proteins were in the 1- to 40-$\mu$M range. Furthermore, we identified several well-established host-virus protein-protein interactions, and confirmed that PDZ domains of Scribble interact with the C terminus of Tax-1 of human T-cell leukemia virus with micromolar affinity. Previously unknown putative viral protein ligands for the PDZ domains of Scribble and Erbin were also identified. Thus, we demonstrate that our ProP-PD libraries are useful tools for probing PDZ domain interactions. The method can be extended to interrogate all potential eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral SLiMs and we suggest it will be a highly valuable approach for studying cellular and pathogen-host protein-protein interactions.},

Herein we developed a procedure to efficiently compare the sequences of large numbers of phage-selected peptides for the purpose of identifying target-binding peptide motifs. We applied the procedure to analyze bicyclic peptides isolated against five different protein targets: sortase A, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, coagulation factor XII, plasma kallikrein and streptavidin. We optimized sequence data filters to reduce biases originating from the sequencing method and developed sequence correction algorithms to prevent identification of false consensus motifs. With our strategy, we were able to identify rare target-binding peptide motifs, as well as to define more precisely consensus sequences and sub-groups of consensus sequences. This information is valuable to choose peptide leads for drug development and it facilitates identification of epitopes. We furthermore show that binding motifs can be identified after a single round of phage selection. Such a selection regimen reduces propagation-related bias and may facilitate application of phage display in non-specialized laboratories, as procedures such as bacterial infection, phage propagation and purification are not required.},

abstract = {The binding of antigens to antibodies is one of the key events in an immune response against foreign molecules and is a critical element of several biomedical applications including vaccines and immunotherapeutics. For development of such applications, the identification of antibody binding sites (B-cell epitopes) is essential. However experimental epitope mapping is highly cost-intensive and computer-aided methods do in general have moderate performance. One major reason for this moderate performance is an incomplete understanding of what characterizes an epitope. To fill this gap, we here developed a novel framework for comparing and superimposing B-cell epitopes and applied it on a dataset of 107 non-similar antigen:antibody structures extracted from the PDB database. With the presented framework, we were able to describe the general B-cell epitope as a flat, oblong, oval shaped volume consisting of predominantly hydrophobic amino acids in the center flanked by charged residues. The average epitope was found to be made up of ∼15 residues with one linear stretch of 5 or more residues constituting more than half of the epitope size. Furthermore, the epitope area is predominantly constrained to a plane above the antibody tip, in which the epitope is orientated in a -30° to 60° angle relative to the light to heavy chain antibody direction. Contrary to previously findings, we did not find a significant deviation between the amino acid composition in epitopes and the composition of equally exposed parts of the antigen surface. Our results, in combination with previously findings, give a detailed picture of the B-cell epitope that may be used in development of improved B-cell prediction methods.},

abstract = {The interaction between antibodies and antigens is one of the most important immune system mechanisms for clearing infectious organisms from the host. Antibodies bind to antigens at sites referred to as B-cell epitopes. Identification of the exact location of B-cell epitopes is essential in several biomedical applications such as; rational vaccine design, development of disease diagnostics and immunotherapeutics. However, experimental mapping of epitopes is resource intensive making in silico methods an appealing complementary approach. To date, the reported performance of methods for in silico mapping of B-cell epitopes has been moderate. Several issues regarding the evaluation data sets may however have led to the performance values being underestimated: Rarely, all potential epitopes have been mapped on an antigen, and antibodies are generally raised against the antigen in a given biological context not against the antigen monomer. Improper dealing with these aspects leads to many artificial false positive predictions and hence to incorrect low performance values. To demonstrate the impact of proper benchmark definitions, we here present an updated version of the DiscoTope method incorporating a novel spatial neighborhood definition and half-sphere exposure as surface measure. Compared to other state-of-the-art prediction methods, Discotope-2.0 displayed improved performance both in cross-validation and in independent evaluations. Using DiscoTope-2.0, we assessed the impact on performance when using proper benchmark definitions. For 13 proteins in the training data set where sufficient biological information was available to make a proper benchmark redefinition, the average AUC performance was improved from 0.791 to 0.824. Similarly, the average AUC performance on an independent evaluation data set improved from 0.712 to 0.727. Our results thus demonstrate that given proper benchmark definitions, B-cell epitope prediction methods achieve highly significant predictive performances suggesting these tools to be a powerful asset in rational epitope discovery. The updated version of DiscoTope is available at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/DiscoTope-2.0.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polyclonal serum consists of vast collections of antibodies, products of differentiated B-cells. The spectrum of antibody specificities is dynamic and varies with age, physiology, and exposure to pathological insults. The complete repertoire of antibody specificities in blood, the IgOme, is therefore an extraordinarily rich source of information-a molecular record of previous encounters as well as a status report of current immune activity. The ability to profile antibody specificities of polyclonal serum at exceptionally high resolution has been an important and serious challenge which can now be overcome.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we illustrate the application of Deep Panning, a method that combines the flexibility of combinatorial phage display of random peptides with the power of high-throughput deep sequencing. Deep Panning is first applied to evaluate the quality and diversity of na{\"{i}}ve random peptide libraries. The production of very large data sets, hundreds of thousands of peptides, has revealed unexpected properties of combinatorial random peptide libraries and indicates correctives to ensure the quality of the libraries generated. Next, Deep Panning is used to analyze a model monoclonal antibody in addition to allowing one to follow the dynamics of biopanning and peptide selection. Finally Deep Panning is applied to profile polyclonal sera derived from HIV infected individuals.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The ability to generate and characterize hundreds of thousands of affinity-selected peptides creates an effective means towards the interrogation of the IgOme and understanding of the humoral response to disease. Deep Panning should open the door to new possibilities for serological diagnostics, vaccine design and the discovery of the correlates of immunity to emerging infectious agents.},

abstract = {An important issue for the performance and specificity of an antibody is the nature of the binding to its protein target, including if the recognition involves linear or conformational epitopes. Here, we dissect polyclonal sera by creating epitope-specific antibody fractions using a combination of epitope mapping and an affinity capture approach involving both synthesized peptides and recombinant protein fragments. This allowed us to study the relative amounts of antibodies to linear and conformational epitopes in the polyclonal sera as well as the ability of each antibody-fraction to detect its target protein in Western blot assays. The majority of the analyzed polyclonal sera were found to have most of the target-specific antibodies directed towards linear epitopes and these were in many cases giving Western blot bands of correct molecular weight. In contrast, many of the antibodies towards conformational epitopes did not bind their target proteins in the Western blot assays. The results from this work have given us insights regarding the nature of the antibody response generated by immunization with recombinant protein fragments and has demonstrated the advantage of using antibodies recognizing linear epitopes for immunoassay involving wholly or partially denatured protein targets.},

abstract = {Antibodies play an important role in modern science and medicine. They are essential in many biological assays and have emerged as an important class of therapeutics. Unfortunately, current methods for mapping antibody epitopes require costly synthesis or enrichment steps, and no low-cost universal platform exists. In order to address this, we tested a random-sequence peptide microarray consisting of over 330,000 unique peptide sequences sampling 83{\%} of all possible tetramers and 27{\%} of pentamers. It is a single, unbiased platform that can be used in many different types of tests, it does not rely on informatic selection of peptides for a particular proteome, and it does not require iterative rounds of selection. In order to optimize the platform, we developed an algorithm that considers the significance of k-length peptide subsequences (k-mers) within selected peptides that come from the microarray. We tested eight monoclonal antibodies and seven infectious disease cohorts. The method correctly identified five of the eight monoclonal epitopes and identified both reported and unreported epitope candidates in the infectious disease cohorts. This algorithm could greatly enhance the utility of random-sequence peptide microarrays by enabling rapid epitope mapping and antigen identification.},

abstract = {Antibodies are of importance for the field of proteomics, both as reagents for imaging cells, tissues, and organs and as capturing agents for affinity enrichment in mass-spectrometry-based techniques. It is important to gain basic insights regarding the binding sites (epitopes) of antibodies and potential cross-reactivity to nontarget proteins. Knowledge about an antibody's linear epitopes is also useful in, for instance, developing assays involving the capture of peptides obtained from trypsin cleavage of samples prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Here, we describe, for the first time, the design and use of peptide arrays covering all human proteins for the analysis of antibody specificity, based on parallel in situ photolithic synthesis of a total of 2.1 million overlapping peptides. This has allowed analysis of on- and off-target binding of both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, complemented with precise mapping of epitopes based on full amino acid substitution scans. The analysis suggests that linear epitopes are relatively short, confined to five to seven residues, resulting in apparent off-target binding to peptides corresponding to a large number of unrelated human proteins. However, subsequent analysis using recombinant proteins suggests that these linear epitopes have a strict conformational component, thus giving us new insights regarding how antibodies bind to their antigens.},

VLP-based vaccines can be used to elicit long-lasting, high-titer antibody responses against diverse target antigens, even self-antigens. Most VLP platform-based vaccines are rationally engineered; specific target epitopes or domains are arrayed so that they are displayed at high-valency on the surface of VLPs. In this review, we describe an alternate technique for vaccine discovery using VLPs. This strategy, analogous to filamentous phage display, allows bacteriophage VLP-based vaccines to be identified from a vast library of potential vaccines by affinity selection. This technology integrates epitope discovery and immunization functions into a single platform.},

@article{Gershoni2007,
abstract = {Antibodies are an effective line of defense in preventing infectious diseases. Highly potent neutralizing antibodies can intercept a virus before it attaches to its target cell and, thus, inactivate it. This ability is based on the antibodies' specific recognition of epitopes, the sites of the antigen to which antibodies bind. Thus, understanding the antibody/epitope interaction provides a basis for the rational design of preventive vaccines. It is assumed that immunization with the precise epitope, corresponding to an effective neutralizing antibody, would elicit the generation of similarly potent antibodies in the vaccinee. Such a vaccine would be a 'B-cell epitope-based vaccine', the implementation of which requires the ability to backtrack from a desired antibody to its corresponding epitope. In this article we discuss a range of methods that enable epitope discovery based on a specific antibody. Such a reversed immunological approach is the first step in the rational design of an epitope-based vaccine. Undoubtedly, the gold standard for epitope definition is x-ray analyses of crystals of antigen:antibody complexes. This method provides atomic resolution of the epitope; however, it is not readily applicable to many antigens and antibodies, and requires a very high degree of sophistication and expertise. Most other methods rely on the ability to monitor the binding of the antibody to antigen fragments or mutated variations. In mutagenesis of the antigen, loss of binding due to point modification of an amino acid residue is often considered an indication of an epitope component. In addition, computational combinatorial methods for epitope mapping are also useful. These methods rely on the ability of the antibody of interest to affinity isolate specific short peptides from combinatorial phage display peptide libraries. The peptides are then regarded as leads for the definition of the epitope corresponding to the antibody used to screen the peptide library. For epitope mapping, computational algorithms have been developed, such as Mapitope, which has recently been found to be effective in mapping conformational discontinuous epitopes. The pros and cons of various approaches towards epitope mapping are also discussed.},

abstract = {Antibodies that react with many different molecular species of protein and non-protein nature are widely studied in biology and have particular utilities, but the precise epitopes recognized are seldom well defined. The definition of epitopes by X-ray crystallography of the antigen-antibody complex, the gold standard procedure, has shown that most antibody epitopes are conformational and specified by interactions with topographic determinants on the surface of the antigenic molecule. Techniques available for the definition of such epitopes are limited. Phage display using either gene-specific libraries, or random peptide libraries, provides a powerful technique for an approach to epitope identification. The technique can identify amino acids on protein antigens that are critical for antibody binding and, further, the isolation of peptide motifs that are both structural and functional mimotopes of both protein and non-protein antigens. This review discusses techniques used to isolate such mimotopes, to confirm their specificity, and to characterize peptide epitopes. Moreover there are direct practical applications to deriving epitopes or mimotopes by sequence, notably the development of new diagnostic reagents, or therapeutic agonist or antagonist molecules. The techniques developed for mapping of antibody epitopes are applicable to probing the origins of autoimmune diseases and certain cancers by identifying "immunofootprints" of unknown initiating agents, as we discuss herein, and are directly applicable to examination of a wider range of receptor-ligand interactions.},

abstract = {Distributions of the backbone dihedral angles of proteins have been studied for over 40 years. While many statistical analyses have been presented, only a handful of probability densities are publicly available for use in structure validation and structure prediction methods. The available distributions differ in a number of important ways, which determine their usefulness for various purposes. These include: 1) input data size and criteria for structure inclusion (resolution, R-factor, etc.); 2) filtering of suspect conformations and outliers using B-factors or other features; 3) secondary structure of input data (e.g., whether helix and sheet are included; whether beta turns are included); 4) the method used for determining probability densities ranging from simple histograms to modern nonparametric density estimation; and 5) whether they include nearest neighbor effects on the distribution of conformations in different regions of the Ramachandran map. In this work, Ramachandran probability distributions are presented for residues in protein loops from a high-resolution data set with filtering based on calculated electron densities. Distributions for all 20 amino acids (with cis and trans proline treated separately) have been determined, as well as 420 left-neighbor and 420 right-neighbor dependent distributions. The neighbor-independent and neighbor-dependent probability densities have been accurately estimated using Bayesian nonparametric statistical analysis based on the Dirichlet process. In particular, we used hierarchical Dirichlet process priors, which allow sharing of information between densities for a particular residue type and different neighbor residue types. The resulting distributions are tested in a loop modeling benchmark with the program Rosetta, and are shown to improve protein loop conformation prediction significantly. The distributions are available at http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/hdp.},

abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for the majority of cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters as well as the senses of sight, olfaction and taste. The paradigm of GPCR signalling is the activation of a heterotrimeric GTP binding protein (G protein) by an agonist-occupied receptor. The $\beta$(2) adrenergic receptor ($\beta$(2)AR) activation of Gs, the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase, has long been a model system for GPCR signalling. Here we present the crystal structure of the active state ternary complex composed of agonist-occupied monomeric $\beta$(2)AR and nucleotide-free Gs heterotrimer. The principal interactions between the $\beta$(2)AR and Gs involve the amino- and carboxy-terminal $\alpha$-helices of Gs, with conformational changes propagating to the nucleotide-binding pocket. The largest conformational changes in the $\beta$(2)AR include a 14 {\AA} outward movement at the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane segment 6 (TM6) and an $\alpha$-helical extension of the cytoplasmic end of TM5. The most surprising observation is a major displacement of the $\alpha$-helical domain of G$\alpha$s relative to the Ras-like GTPase domain. This crystal structure represents the first high-resolution view of transmembrane signalling by a GPCR.},

abstract = {During the past few years, crystallography of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has experienced exponential growth, resulting in the determination of the structures of 16 distinct receptors-9 of them in 2012 alone. Including closely related subtype homology models, this coverage amounts to approximately 12{\%} of the human GPCR superfamily. The adrenergic, rhodopsin, and adenosine receptor systems are also described by agonist-bound active-state structures, including a structure of the receptor-G protein complex for the $\beta$(2)-adrenergic receptor. Biochemical and biophysical techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance and hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry, are providing complementary insights into ligand-dependent dynamic equilibrium between different functional states. Additional details revealed by high-resolution structures illustrate the receptors as allosteric machines that are controlled not only by ligands but also by ions, lipids, cholesterol, and water. This wealth of data is helping redefine our knowledge of how GPCRs recognize such a diverse array of ligands and how they transmit signals 30 angstroms across the cell membrane; it also is shedding light on a structural basis of GPCR allosteric modulation and biased signaling.},

abstract = {Rhodopsin is a specialized G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) found in vertebrate rod cells. Absorption of light by its 11-cis retinal chromophore leads to rapid photochemical isomerization and receptor activation. Recent results from protein crystallography and NMR spectroscopy show how structural changes on the extracellular side of rhodopsin induced by retinal isomerization are coupled to the motion of membrane-spanning helices to create a G protein binding pocket on the intracellular side of the receptor. The signaling pathway provides a comprehensive explanation for the conservation of specific amino acids and structural motifs across the class A family of GPCRs, as well as for the conservation of selected residues within the visual receptor subfamily. The emerging model of activation indicates that, rather than being unique, the visual receptors provide a basis for understanding the common structural and dynamic elements in the class A GPCRs.},

abstract = {Enzyme catalysis is central to almost all biochemical processes, speeding up rates of reactions to biological relevant timescales. Enzymes make use of a large ensemble of conformations in recognizing their substrates and stabilizing the transition states, due to the inherent dynamical nature of biomolecules. The exact role of these diverse enzyme conformations and the interplay between enzyme conformational dynamics and catalysis is, according to the literature, not well understood. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study human cyclophilin A (CypA), in order to understand the role of enzyme motions in the catalytic mechanism and recognition. Cyclophilin A is a tractable model system to study using classical simulation methods, because catalysis does not involve bond formation or breakage. We show that the conformational dynamics of active site residues of substrate-bound CypA is inherent in the substrate-free enzyme. CypA interacts with its substrate via conformational selection as the configurations of the substrate changes during catalysis. We also show that, in addition to tight intermolecular hydrophobic interactions between CypA and the substrate, an intricate enzyme-substrate intermolecular hydrogen-bonding network is extremely sensitive to the configuration of the substrate. These enzyme-substrate intermolecular interactions are loosely formed when the substrate is in the reactant and product states and become well formed and reluctant to break when the substrate is in the transition state. Our results clearly suggest coupling among enzyme-substrate intermolecular interactions, the dynamics of the enzyme, and the chemical step. This study provides further insights into the mechanism of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases and the general interplay between enzyme conformational dynamics and catalysis.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous, eukaryotic, high-mobility group box (HMGB) chromosomal proteins promote many chromatin-mediated cellular activities through their non-sequence-specific binding and bending of DNA. Minor-groove DNA binding by the HMG box results in substantial DNA bending toward the major groove owing to electrostatic interactions, shape complementarity, and DNA intercalation that occurs at two sites. Here, the structures of the complexes formed with DNA by a partially DNA intercalation-deficient mutant of Drosophila melanogaster HMGD have been determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 2.85 {\AA}. The six proteins and 50 bp of DNA in the crystal structure revealed a variety of bound conformations. All of the proteins bound in the minor groove, bridging DNA molecules, presumably because these DNA regions are easily deformed. The loss of the primary site of DNA intercalation decreased overall DNA bending and shape complementarity. However, DNA bending at the secondary site of intercalation was retained and most protein-DNA contacts were preserved. The mode of binding resembles the HMGB1 box A-cisplatin-DNA complex, which also lacks a primary intercalating residue. This study provides new insights into the binding mechanisms used by HMG boxes to recognize varied DNA structures and sequences as well as modulate DNA structure and DNA bending.},

abstract = {High mobility group (HMG) proteins are nuclear proteins believed to significantly affect DNA interactions by altering nucleic acid flexibility. Group B (HMGB) proteins contain HMG box domains known to bind to the DNA minor groove without sequence specificity, slightly intercalating base pairs and inducing a strong bend in the DNA helical axis. A dual-beam optical tweezers system is used to extend double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the absence as well as presence of a single box derivative of human HMGB2 [HMGB2(box A)] and a double box derivative of rat HMGB1 [HMGB1(box A+box B)]. The single box domain is observed to reduce the persistence length of the double helix, generating sharp DNA bends with an average bending angle of 99+/-9 degrees and, at very high concentrations, stabilizing dsDNA against denaturation. The double box protein contains two consecutive HMG box domains joined by a flexible tether. This protein also reduces the DNA persistence length, induces an average bending angle of 77+/-7 degrees , and stabilizes dsDNA at significantly lower concentrations. These results suggest that single and double box proteins increase DNA flexibility and stability, albeit both effects are achieved at much lower protein concentrations for the double box. In addition, at low concentrations, the single box protein can alter DNA flexibility without stabilizing dsDNA, whereas stabilization at higher concentrations is likely achieved through a cooperative binding mode.},

Cyclophilin A forms a ternary complex with cyclosporin A and the calcium-calmodulin-activated serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase calcineurin; formation of this complex prevents calcineurin from regulating cytokine gene transcription.

abstract = {Plant architecture is an important agronomic trait and is useful for identification of plant species. The molecular basis of plant architecture, however, is largely unknown. Forward genetics was used to identify an Arabidopsis mutant with altered plant architecture. Using genetic and molecular approaches, we analyzed the roles of a mutated cyclophilin in the control of plant architecture. The Arabidopsis mutant roc1 has reduced stem elongation and increased shoot branching, and the mutant phenotypes are strongly affected by temperature and photoperiod. Map-based cloning and transgenic experiments demonstrated that the roc1 mutant phenotypes are caused by a gain-of-function mutation in a cyclophilin gene, ROC1. Besides, application of the plant hormone gibberellic acid (GA) further suppresses stem elongation in the mutant. GA treatment enhances the accumulation of mutated but not of wildtype (WT) ROC1 proteins. The roc1 mutation does not seem to interfere with GA biosynthesis or signaling. GA signaling, however, antagonizes the effect of the roc1 mutation on stem elongation. The altered plant architecture may result from the activation of an R gene by the roc1 protein. We also present a working model for the interaction between the roc1 mutation and GA signaling in regulating stem elongation.},

abstract = {The citrus (Citrus sinensis) cyclophilin CsCyp is a target of the Xanthomonas citri transcription activator-like effector PthA, required to elicit cankers on citrus. CsCyp binds the citrus thioredoxin CsTdx and the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and is a divergent cyclophilin that carries the additional loop KSGKPLH, invariable cysteine (Cys) residues Cys-40 and Cys-168, and the conserved glutamate (Glu) Glu-83. Despite the suggested roles in ATP and metal binding, the functions of these unique structural elements remain unknown. Here, we show that the conserved Cys residues form a disulfide bond that inactivates the enzyme, whereas Glu-83, which belongs to the catalytic loop and is also critical for enzyme activity, is anchored to the divergent loop to maintain the active site open. In addition, we demonstrate that Cys-40 and Cys-168 are required for the interaction with CsTdx and that CsCyp binds the citrus carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II YSPSAP repeat. Our data support a model where formation of the Cys-40-Cys-168 disulfide bond induces a conformational change that disrupts the interaction of the divergent and catalytic loops, via Glu-83, causing the active site to close. This suggests a new type of allosteric regulation in divergent cyclophilins, involving disulfide bond formation and a loop-displacement mechanism.},

abstract = {Elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) binds to all standard aminoacyl transfer RNAs (aa-tRNAs) and transports them to the ribosome while protecting the ester linkage between the tRNA and its cognate amino acid. We use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamics of the EF-Tu.guanosine 5'-triphosphate.aa-tRNA(Cys) complex and the roles played by Mg2+ ions and modified nucleosides on the free energy of protein.RNA binding. Individual modified nucleosides have pronounced effects on the structural dynamics of tRNA and the EF-Tu.Cys-tRNA(Cys) interface. Combined energetic and evolutionary analyses identify the coevolution of residues in EF-Tu and aa-tRNAs at the binding interface. Highly conserved EF-Tu residues are responsible for both attracting aa-tRNAs as well as providing nearby nonbonded repulsive energies that help fine-tune molecular attraction at the binding interface. In addition to the 3' CCA end, highly conserved tRNA nucleotides G1, G52, G53, and U54 contribute significantly to EF-Tu binding energies. Modification of U54 to thymine affects the structure of the tRNA common loop resulting in a change in binding interface contacts. In addition, other nucleotides, conserved within certain tRNA specificities, may be responsible for tuning aa-tRNA binding to EF-Tu. The trend in EF-Tu.Cys-tRNA(Cys) binding energies observed as the result of mutating the tRNA agrees with experimental observation. We also predict variations in binding free energies upon misacylation of tRNA(Cys) with d-cysteine or O-phosphoserine and upon changing the protonation state of l-cysteine. Principal components analysis in each case reveals changes in the communication network across the protein.tRNA interface and is the basis for the entropy calculations.},

abstract = {The energetics of the Sox-5 HMG box interaction with DNA duplexes, containing the recognition sequence AACAAT, were studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fluorescence titration showed that the association constant of this HMG box with the duplexes is of the order 4x10(7) M(-1), increasing somewhat with temperature rise, i.e. the Gibbs energy is -40 kJ mol(-1) at 5 degrees C, decreasing to -48 kJ mol(-1) at 32 degrees C. ITC measurements of the enthalpy of association over this temperature range showed an endothermic effect below 17 degrees C and an exothermic effect above, suggesting a heat capacity change on binding of about -4 kJ K(-1) mol(-1), a value twice larger than expected from structural considerations. A straightforward interpretation of ITC data in heat capacity terms assumes, however, that the heat capacities of all participants in the association reaction do not change over the considered temperature range. Our previous studies showed that over the temperature range of the ITC experiments the HMG box of Sox-5 starts to unfold, absorbing heat and the heat capacities of the DNA duplexes also increase significantly. These heat capacity effects differ from that of the DNA/Sox-5 complex. Correcting the ITC measured binding enthalpies for the heat capacity changes of the components and complex yielded the net enthalpies which exhibit a temperature dependence of about -2 kJ K(-1) mol(-1), in good agreement with that predicted on the basis of dehydration of the protein-DNA interface. Using the derived heat capacity change and the enthalpy and Gibbs energy of association measured at 5 degrees C, the net enthalpy and entropy of association of the fully folded HMG box with the target DNA duplexes was determined over a broad temperature range. These functions were compared with those for other known cases of sequence specific DNA/protein association. It appears that the enthalpy and entropy of association of minor groove binding proteins are more positive than for proteins binding in the major groove. The observed thermodynamic characteristics of protein binding to the A+T-rich minor groove of DNA might result from dehydration of both polar and non-polar groups at the interface and release of counterions. The expected entropy of dehydration was calculated and found to be too large to be compensated by the negative entropy of reduction of translational/rotational freedom. This implies that DNA/HMG box association proceeds with significant decrease of conformational entropy, i.e. reduction in conformational mobility.},

abstract = {The thermal properties and energetics of formation of 10, 12 and 16 bp DNA duplexes, specifically interacting with the HMG box of Sox-5, have been studied by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). DSC studies show that the partial heat capacity of these short duplexes increases considerably prior to the cooperative process of strand separation. Direct extrapolation of the pre and post-transition heat capacity functions into the cooperative transition zone suggests that unfolding/dissociation of strands results in no apparent heat capacity increment. In contrast, ITC measurements show that the negative enthalpy of complementary strand association increases in magnitude with temperature rise, implying that strand association proceeds with significant decrease of heat capacity. Furthermore, the ITC-measured enthalpy of strand association is significantly smaller in magnitude than the enthalpy of cooperative unfolding measured by DSC. To resolve this paradox, the heat effects upon heating and cooling of the separate DNA strands have been measured by DSC. This showed that cooling of the strands from 100 degrees C to -10 degrees C proceeds with significant heat release associated with the formation of intra and inter-molecular interactions. When the enthalpy of residual structure in the strands and the temperature dependence of the heat capacity of the duplexes and of their unfolded strands have been taken into account, the ITC and DSC results are brought into agreement. The analysis shows that the considerable increase in heat capacity of the duplexes with temperature rise is due to increasing fluctuations of their structure (e.g. end fraying and twisting) and this effect obscures the heat capacity increment resulting from the cooperative separation of strands, which in fact amounts to 200(+/-40) JK(-1) (mol bp)(-1). Using this heat capacity increment, the averaged standard enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy of formation of fully folded duplexes from fully unfolded strands have been determined at 25 degrees C as -33(+/-2) kJ (mol bp)(-1), -93(+/-4) J K(-1) (mol bp)(-1) and -5.0(+/-0.5) kJ (mol bp)(-1), respectively.},

abstract = {To clarify the physical basis of DNA binding specificity, the thermodynamic properties and DNA binding and bending abilities of the DNA binding domains (DBDs) of sequence-specific (SS) and non-sequence-specific (NSS) HMG box proteins were studied with various DNA recognition sequences using micro-calorimetric and optical methods. Temperature-induced unfolding of the free DBDs showed that their structure does not represent a single cooperative unit but is subdivided into two (in the case of NSS DBDs) or three (in the case of SS DBDs) sub-domains, which differ in stability. Both types of HMG box, most particularly SS, are partially unfolded even at room temperature but association with DNA results in stabilization and cooperation of all the sub-domains. Binding and bending measurements using fluorescence spectroscopy over a range of ionic strengths, combined with calorimetric data, allowed separation of the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the Gibbs energies of DNA binding, yielding their enthalpic and entropic terms and an estimate of their contributions to DNA binding and bending. In all cases electrostatic interactions dominate non-electrostatic in the association of a DBD with DNA. The main difference between SS and NSS complexes is that SS are formed with an enthalpy close to zero and a negative heat capacity effect, while NSS are formed with a very positive enthalpy and a positive heat capacity effect. This indicates that formation of SS HMG box-DNA complexes is specified by extensive van der Waals contacts between apolar groups, i.e. a more tightly packed interface forms than in NSS complexes. The other principal difference is that DNA bending by the NSS DBDs is driven almost entirely by the electrostatic component of the binding energy, while DNA bending by SS DBDs is driven mainly by the non-electrostatic component. The basic extensions of both categories of HMG box play a similar role in DNA binding and bending, making solely electrostatic interactions with the DNA.},

abstract = {The thermal properties of two forms of the Drosophila melanogaster HMG-D protein, with and without its highly basic 26 residue C-terminal tail (D100 and D74) and the thermodynamics of their non-sequence-specific interaction with linear DNA duplexes were studied using scanning and titration microcalorimetry, spectropolarimetry, fluorescence anisotropy and FRET techniques at different temperatures and salt concentrations. It was shown that the C-terminal tail of D100 is unfolded at all temperatures, whilst the state of the globular part depends on temperature in a rather complex way, being completely folded only at temperatures close to 0 °C and unfolding with significant heat absorption at temperatures below those of the gross denaturational changes. The association constant and thus Gibbs energy of binding for D100 is much greater than for D74 but the enthalpies of their association are similar and are large and positive, i.e. DNA binding is a completely entropy-driven process. The positive entropy of association is due to release of counterions and dehydration upon forming the protein/DNA complex. Ionic strength variation showed that electrostatic interactions play an important but not exclusive role in the DNA binding of the globular part of this non-sequence-specific protein, whilst binding of the positively charged C-terminal tail of D100 is almost completely electrostatic in origin. This interaction with the negative charges of the DNA phosphate groups significantly enhances the DNA bending. An important feature of the non-sequence-specific association of these HMG boxes with DNA is that the binding enthalpy is significantly more positive than for the sequence-specific association of the HMG box from Sox-5, despite the fact that these proteins bend the DNA duplex to a similar extent. This difference shows that the enthalpy of dehydration of apolar groups at the HMG-D/DNA interface is not fully compensated by the energy of van der Waals interactions between these groups, i.e. the packing density at the interface must be lower than for the sequence-specific Sox-5 HMG box.},

However, the understanding of the function of chromosomal proteins at the molecular level has been hampered by the lack of structures of chromosomal protein-DNA complexes. We have carried out a molecular dynamics modeling study to provide insight into the mode of DNA binding to the chromosomal HMG-domain protein, HMG-D. Three models of a complex of HMG-D bound to DNA were derived through docking the protein to two different DNA fragments of known structure. Molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes provided data indicating the most favorable model. This model was further refined by molecular dynamics simulation and extensively analyzed. The structure of the corresponding HMG-D-DNA complex exhibits many features seen in the NMR structures of the sequence-specific HMG-domain-DNA complexes, lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF-1) and testis determining factor (SRY). The model reveals differences from these known structures that suggest how chromosomal proteins bind to many different DNA sequences with comparable affinity.},

The error rate of all algorithms is greatly reduced by using statistical scores to evaluate matches rather than percentage identity or raw scores. The E-value statistical scores of SSEARCH and FASTA are reliable: the number of false positives found in our tests agrees well with the scores reported. However, the P-values reported by BLAST and WU-BLAST2 exaggerate significance by orders of magnitude. SSEARCH, FASTA ktup = 1, and WU-BLAST2 perform best, and they are capable of detecting almost all relationships between proteins whose sequence identities are {\textgreater}30{\%}. For more distantly related proteins, they do much less well; only one-half of the relationships between proteins with 20-30{\%} identity are found. Because many homologs have low sequence similarity, most distant relationships cannot be detected by any pairwise comparison method; however, those which are identified may be used with confidence.},

abstract = {Global alignment is used to compare proteins in different fields, for example in phylogenetic research. In order to reduce the length and composition dependence of global alignment scores, Z-score is computed with a Monte-Carlo algorithm. This technique requires a great number of sequence alignments on shuffled sequences, leading to a high computational cost. In this work, a normalized global alignment score is introduced in order to correct the length dependence of global alignments. This score is defined as the best ratio between the score of an alignment and its length, and an algorithm to compute it based on fractional programming is implemented. The properties and effectiveness of normalized global alignment applied to protein comparison are analyzed. Experiments with proteins selected from the SCOP ASTRAL database were run to study relationship of normalized global alignment with Z-score and performance in homologous detection. Results show that normalized global alignment has a computational cost equivalent to 2.5 Needleman-Wunsch runs and a linear relationship with Z-score. This linearity allows us to use normalized global alignment as a cheap substitute to a computationally expensive Z-score. Experiments show that normalized global alignment improves the ability to identify homologous proteins. Software used to compute normalized global alignments is available from http://www3.uji.es/∼peris/nga.},

abstract = {Sequence comparison is a major step in the prediction of protein structure from existing templates in the Protein Data Bank. The identification of potentially remote homologues to be used as templates for modeling target sequences of unknown structure and their accurate alignment remain challenges, despite many years of study. The most recent advances have been in combining as many sources of information as possible--including amino acid variation in the form of profiles or hidden Markov models for both the target and template families, known and predicted secondary structures of the template and target, respectively, the combination of structure alignment for distant homologues and sequence alignment for close homologues to build better profiles, and the anchoring of certain regions of the alignment based on existing biological data. Newer technologies have been applied to the problem, including the use of support vector machines to tackle the fold classification problem for a target sequence and the alignment of hidden Markov models. Finally, using the consensus of many fold recognition methods, whether based on profile-profile alignments, threading or other approaches, continues to be one of the most successful strategies for both recognition and alignment of remote homologues. Although there is still room for improvement in identification and alignment methods, additional progress may come from model building and refinement methods that can compensate for large structural changes between remotely related targets and templates, as well as for regions of misalignment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prediction of 3-dimensional protein structures from amino acid sequences represents one of the most important problems in computational structural biology. The community-wide Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) experiments have been designed to obtain an objective assessment of the state-of-the-art of the field, where I-TASSER was ranked as the best method in the server section of the recent 7th CASP experiment. Our laboratory has since then received numerous requests about the public availability of the I-TASSER algorithm and the usage of the I-TASSER predictions.

RESULTS: An on-line version of I-TASSER is developed at the KU Center for Bioinformatics which has generated protein structure predictions for thousands of modeling requests from more than 35 countries. A scoring function (C-score) based on the relative clustering structural density and the consensus significance score of multiple threading templates is introduced to estimate the accuracy of the I-TASSER predictions. A large-scale benchmark test demonstrates a strong correlation between the C-score and the TM-score (a structural similarity measurement with values in [0, 1]) of the first models with a correlation coefficient of 0.91. Using a C-score cutoff {\textgreater} -1.5 for the models of correct topology, both false positive and false negative rates are below 0.1. Combining C-score and protein length, the accuracy of the I-TASSER models can be predicted with an average error of 0.08 for TM-score and 2 A for RMSD.

CONCLUSION: The I-TASSER server has been developed to generate automated full-length 3D protein structural predictions where the benchmarked scoring system helps users to obtain quantitative assessments of the I-TASSER models. The output of the I-TASSER server for each query includes up to five full-length models, the confidence score, the estimated TM-score and RMSD, and the standard deviation of the estimations. The I-TASSER server is freely available to the academic community at http://zhang.bioinformatics.ku.edu/I-TASSER.},

abstract = {Protein structure determination and predictive modeling have long been guided by the paradigm that the peptide backbone has a single, context-independent ideal geometry. Both quantum-mechanics calculations and empirical analyses have shown this is an incorrect simplification in that backbone covalent geometry actually varies systematically as a function of the phi and Psi backbone dihedral angles. Here, we use a nonredundant set of ultrahigh-resolution protein structures to define these conformation-dependent variations. The trends have a rational, structural basis that can be explained by avoidance of atomic clashes or optimization of favorable electrostatic interactions. To facilitate adoption of this paradigm, we have created a conformation-dependent library of covalent bond lengths and bond angles and shown that it has improved accuracy over existing methods without any additional variables to optimize. Protein structures derived from crystallographic refinement and predictive modeling both stand to benefit from incorporation of the paradigm.},

abstract = {The planarity of peptide bonds is an assumption that underlies decades of theoretical modeling of proteins. Peptide bonds strongly deviating from planarity are considered very rare features of protein structure that occur for functional reasons. Here, empirical analyses of atomic-resolution protein structures reveal that trans peptide groups can vary by more than 25° from planarity and that the true extent of nonplanarity is underestimated even in 1.2 Å resolution structures. Analyses as a function of the ϕ,$\psi$-backbone dihedral angles show that the expected value deviates by ± 8° from planar as a systematic function of conformation, but that the large majority of variation in planarity depends on tertiary effects. Furthermore, we show that those peptide bonds in proteins that are most nonplanar, deviating by over 20° from planarity, are not strongly associated with active sites. Instead, highly nonplanar peptides are simply integral components of protein structure related to local and tertiary structural features that tend to be conserved among homologs. To account for the systematic ϕ,$\psi$-dependent component of nonplanarity, we present a conformation-dependent library that can be used in crystallographic refinement and predictive protein modeling.},

Although experimental structure determination methods are providing high-resolution structure information about a subset of the proteins, computational structure prediction methods will provide valuable information for the large fraction of sequences whose structures will not be determined experimentally. The first class of protein structure prediction methods, including threading and comparative modeling, rely on detectable similarity spanning most of the modeled sequence and at least one known structure. The second class of methods, de novo or ab initio methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on similarity at the fold level between the modeled sequence and any of the known structures. In this Viewpoint, we begin by describing the essential features of the methods, the accuracy of the models, and their application to the prediction and understanding of protein function, both for single proteins and on the scale of whole genomes.

The article describes the conduct of the experiment, the categories of prediction included, and outlines the evaluation and assessment procedures. The 10 CASP experiments span almost 20 years of progress in the field of protein structure modeling, and there have been enormous advances in methods and model accuracy in that period. Notable in this round is the first sustained improvement of models with refinement methods, using molecular dynamics. For the first time, we tested the ability of modeling methods to make use of sparse experimental three-dimensional contact information, such as may be obtained from new experimental techniques, with encouraging results. On the other hand, new contact prediction methods, though holding considerable promise, have yet to make an impact in CASP testing. The nature of CASP targets has been changing in recent CASPs, reflecting shifts in experimental structural biology, with more irregular structures, more multi-domain and multi-subunit structures, and less standard versions of known folds. When allowance is made for these factors, we continue to see steady progress in the overall accuracy of models, particularly resulting from improvement of non-template regions.},

abstract = {Fold recognition from sequence can be an important step in protein structure and function prediction. Many methods have tackled this goal. Most of them, based on sequence alignment, fail for sequences of low similarity. Alignment-free approaches can provide an efficient alternative. For such approaches, the identification of efficient fold discriminatory features is critical. We propose a new fold recognition approach that relies on the encoding of the local structure of proteins using a Hidden Markov Model Structural Alphabet. This encoding provides a 1D description of the conformation of complete proteins structures, including loops. At the fold level, compared with the classical secondary structure helix, strand, and coil states, such encoding is expected to provide the means of a better discrimination between loop conformations, hence providing better fold identification. Compared with previous related approaches, this supplement of information results in significant improvement. When combining this information with supplementary information of secondary structure and residue burial, we obtain a fold recognition accuracy of 78{\%} for 27 protein families, that is, 8{\%} higher than the best available method so far, and of 68{\%} for 60 families. Corresponding scores at the class level are of 92{\%} and 90{\%} indicating that mispredictions are mostly within structural classes.},

abstract = {Predicting accurate fragments from sequence has recently become a critical step for protein structure modeling, as protein fragment assembly techniques are presently among the most efficient approaches for de novo prediction. A key step in these approaches is, given the sequence of a protein to model, the identification of relevant fragments - candidate fragments - from a collection of the available 3D structures. These fragments can then be assembled to produce a model of the complete structure of the protein of interest. The search for candidate fragments is classically achieved by considering local sequence similarity using profile comparison, or threading approaches. In the present study, we introduce a new profile comparison approach that, instead of using amino acid profiles, is based on the use of predicted structural alphabet profiles, where structural alphabet profiles contain information related to the 3D local shapes associated with the sequences. We show that structural alphabet profile-profile comparison can be used efficiently to retrieve accurate structural fragments, and we introduce a fully new protocol for the detection of candidate fragments. It identifies fragments specific of each position of the sequence and of size varying between 6 and 27 amino-acids. We find it outperforms present state of the art approaches in terms (i) of the accuracy of the fragments identified, (ii) the rate of true positives identified, while having a high coverage score. We illustrate the relevance of the approach on complete target sets of the two previous Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) rounds 9 and 10.

abstract = {An important problem in computational biology is predicting the structure of the large number of putative proteins discovered by genome sequencing projects. Fold-recognition methods attempt to solve the problem by relating the target proteins to known structures, searching for template proteins homologous to the target. Remote homologs that may have significant structural similarity are often not detectable by sequence similarities alone. To address this, we incorporated predicted local structure, a generalization of secondary structure, into two-track profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). We did not rely on a simple helix-strand-coil definition of secondary structure, but experimented with a variety of local structure descriptions, following a principled protocol to establish which descriptions are most useful for improving fold recognition and alignment quality. On a test set of 1298 nonhomologous proteins, HMMs incorporating a 3-letter STRIDE alphabet improved fold recognition accuracy by 15{\%} over amino-acid-only HMMs and 23{\%} over PSI-BLAST, measured by ROC-65 numbers. We compared two-track HMMs to amino-acid-only HMMs on a difficult alignment test set of 200 protein pairs (structurally similar with 3-24{\%} sequence identity). HMMs with a 6-letter STRIDE secondary track improved alignment quality by 62{\%}, relative to DALI structural alignments, while HMMs with an STR track (an expanded DSSP alphabet that subdivides strands into six states) improved by 40{\%} relative to CE.},

abstract = {The pattern of residue substitution in divergently evolving families of globular proteins is highly variable. At each position in a fold there are constraints on the identities of amino acids from both the three-dimensional structure and the function of the protein. To characterize and quantify the structural constraints, we have made a comparative analysis of families of homologous globular proteins. Residues are classified according to amino acid type, secondary structure, accessibility of the sidechain, and existence of hydrogen bonds from sidechain to other sidechains or peptide carbonyl or amide functions. There are distinct patterns of substitution especially where residues are both solvent inaccessible and hydrogen bonded through their sidechains. The patterns of residue substitution can be used to construct templates or to identify 'key' residues if one or more structures are known. Conversely, analysis of conversation and substitution across a large family of aligned sequences in terms of substitution profiles can allow prediction of tertiary environment or indicate a functional role. Similar analyses can be used to test the validity of putative structures if several homologous sequences are available.},

abstract = {We develop a new threading algorithm MUSTER by extending the previous sequence profile-profile alignment method, PPA. It combines various sequence and structure information into single-body terms which can be conveniently used in dynamic programming search: (1) sequence profiles; (2) secondary structures; (3) structure fragment profiles; (4) solvent accessibility; (5) dihedral torsion angles; (6) hydrophobic scoring matrix. The balance of the weighting parameters is optimized by a grading search based on the average TM-score of 111 training proteins which shows a better performance than using the conventional optimization methods based on the PROSUP database. The algorithm is tested on 500 nonhomologous proteins independent of the training sets. After removing the homologous templates with a sequence identity to the target {\textgreater}30{\%}, in 224 cases, the first template alignment has the correct topology with a TM-score {\textgreater}0.5. Even with a more stringent cutoff by removing the templates with a sequence identity {\textgreater}20{\%} or detectable by PSI-BLAST with an E-value {\textless}0.05, MUSTER is able to identify correct folds in 137 cases with the first model of TM-score {\textgreater}0.5. Dependent on the homology cutoffs, the average TM-score of the first threading alignments by MUSTER is 5.1-6.3{\%} higher than that by PPA. This improvement is statistically significant by the Wilcoxon signed rank test with a P-value {\textless} 1.0 x 10(-13), which demonstrates the effect of additional structural information on the protein fold recognition.

abstract = {FUGUE, a program for recognizing distant homologues by sequence-structure comparison (http://www-cryst.bioc.cam.ac.uk/fugue/), has three key features. (1) Improved environment-specific substitution tables. Substitutions of an amino acid in a protein structure are constrained by its local structural environment, which can be defined in terms of secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and hydrogen bonding status. The environment-specific substitution tables have been derived from structural alignments in the HOMSTRAD database (http://www-cryst.bioc. cam.ac.uk/homstrad/). (2) Automatic selection of alignment algorithm with detailed structure-dependent gap penalties. FUGUE uses the global-local algorithm to align a sequence-structure pair when they greatly differ in length and uses the global algorithm in other cases. The gap penalty at each position of the structure is determined according to its solvent accessibility, its position relative to the secondary structure elements (SSEs) and the conservation of the SSEs. (3) Combined information from both multiple sequences and multiple structures. FUGUE is designed to align multiple sequences against multiple structures to enrich the conservation/variation information. We demonstrate that the combination of these three key features implemented in FUGUE improves both homology recognition performance and alignment accuracy.},

abstract = {As methods for determining protein three-dimensional (3D) structure develop, a continuing problem is how to verify that the final protein model is correct. The revision of several protein models to correct errors has prompted the development of new criteria for judging the validity of X-ray and NMR structures, as well as the formation of energetic and empirical methods to evaluate the correctness of protein models. The challenge is to distinguish between a mistraced or wrongly folded model, and one that is basically correct, but not adequately refined. We show that an effective test of the accuracy of a 3D protein model is a comparison of the model to its own amino-acid sequence, using a 3D profile, computed from the atomic coordinates of the structure 3D profiles of correct protein structures match their own sequences with high scores. In contrast, 3D profiles for protein models known to be wrong score poorly. An incorrectly modelled segment in an otherwise correct structure can be identified by examining the profile score in a moving-window scan. The accuracy of a protein model can be assessed by its 3D profile, regardless of whether the model has been derived by X-ray, NMR or computational procedures.},

abstract = {A structure alignment program aligns two structures by optimizing a scoring function that measures structural similarity. It is highly desirable that such scoring function is independent of the sizes of proteins in comparison so that the significance of alignment across different sizes of the protein regions aligned is comparable. Here, we developed a new score called SP-score that fixes the cutoff distance at 4 {\AA} and removed the size dependence using a normalization prefactor. We further built a program called SPalign that optimizes SP-score for structure alignment. SPalign was applied to recognize proteins within the same structure fold and having the same function of DNA or RNA binding. For fold discrimination, SPalign improves sensitivity over TMalign for the chain-level comparison by 12{\%} and over DALI for the domain-level comparison by 13{\%} at the same specificity of 99.6{\%}. The difference between TMalign and SPalign at the chain level is due to the inability of TMalign to detect single domain similarity between multidomain proteins. For recognizing nucleic acid binding proteins, SPalign consistently improves over TMalign by 12{\%} and DALI by 31{\%} in average value of Mathews correlation coefficients for four datasets. SPalign with default setting is 14{\%} faster than TMalign. SPalign is expected to be useful for function prediction and comparing structures with or without domains defined. The source code for SPalign and the server are available at http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu.},

abstract = {We have extended the resolution of the crystal structure of human bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (BPI) to 1.7 A. BPI has two domains with the same fold, but with little sequence similarity. To understand the similarity in structure of the two domains, we compare the corresponding residue positions in the two domains by the method of 3D-1D profiles. A 3D-1D profile is a string formed by assigning each position in the 3D structure to one of 18 environment classes. The environment classes are defined by the local secondary structure, the area of the residue which is buried from solvent, and the fraction of the area buried by polar atoms. A structural alignment between the two BPI domains was used to compare the 3D-1D environments of structurally equivalent positions. Greater than 31{\%} of the aligned positions have conserved 3D-1D environments, but only 13{\%} have conserved residue identities. Analysis of the 3D-1D environmentally conserved positions helps to identify pairs of residues likely to be important in conserving the fold, regardless of the residue similarity. We find examples of 3D-1D environmentally conserved positions with dissimilar residues which nevertheless play similar structural roles. To generalize our findings, we analyzed four other proteins with similar structures yet dissimilar sequences. Together, these examples show that aligned pairs of dissimilar residues often share similar structural roles, stabilizing dissimilar sequences in the same fold.},

@article{Russell1994,
abstract = {Side-chain to side-chain contacts, accessibility, secondary structure and RMS deviation were compared within 607 pairs of proteins having similar three-dimensional (3D) structures. Three types of protein 3D structural similarities were defined: type A having sequence and usually functional similarity; type B having functional, but no sequence similarity; and type C having only 3D structural similarity. Within proteins having little or no sequence similarity (types B and C), structural features frequently had a degree of conservation comparable to dissimilar 3D structures. Despite similar protein folds, as few as 30{\%} of residues within similar protein 3D structures can form a common core. RMS deviations on core C alpha atoms can be as high as 3.2 A. Similar protein structures can have secondary structure identities as low as 41{\%}, which is equivalent to that expected by chance. By defining three categories of amino acid accessibility (buried, half buried and exposed), some similar protein 3D structures have as few as 30{\%} of positions in the same category, making them indistinguishable from pairs of dissimilar protein structures. Similar structures can also have as few as 12{\%} of common side-chain to side-chain contacts, and virtually no similar energetically favourable side-chain to side-chain interactions. Complementary changes are defined as structurally equivalent pairs of interacting residues in two structures with energetically favourable but different side-chain interactions. For many proteins with similar three-dimensional structures, the proportion of complementary changes is near to that expected by chance, suggesting that many similar structures have fundamentally different stabilising interactions. All of the results suggest that proteins having similar 3D structures can have little in common apart from a scaffold of core secondary structures. This has profound implications for methods of protein fold detection, since many of the properties assumed to be conserved across similar protein 3D structures (e.g. accessibility, side-chain to side-chain contacts, etc.) are often unconserved within weakly similar (i.e. type B and C) protein 3D structures. Little difference was found between type B and C similarities suggesting that the structure of similar proteins can evolve beyond recognition even when function is conserved. Our findings suggest that it is more general features of protein structure, such as the requirements for burial of hydrophobic residues and exposure of polar residues, rather than specific residue-residue interactions that determine how well a particular sequence adopts a particular fold.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The pathway which proteins take to fold can be influenced from the earliest events of structure formation. In this light, it was both predicted and confirmed that increasing the stiffness of a beta hairpin turn decreased the size of the transition state ensemble (TSE), while increasing the folding rate. Thus, there appears to be a relationship between conformationally restricting the TSE and increasing the folding rate, at least for beta hairpin turns. In this study, we hypothesize that the enormous sampling necessary to fold even two-state folding proteins in silico could be reduced if local structure constraints were used to restrict structural heterogeneity by polarizing folding pathways or forcing folding into preferred routes. Using a Gō model, we fold Chymotrypsin Inhibitor 2 (CI-2) and the src SH3 domain after constraining local sequence windows to their native structure by rigid body dynamics (RBD). Trajectories were monitored for any changes to the folding pathway and differences in the kinetics compared with unconstrained simulations. Constraining local structure decreases folding time two-fold for 41{\%} of src SH3 windows and 45{\%} of CI-2 windows. For both proteins, folding times are never significantly increased after constraining any window. Structural polarization of the folding pathway appears to explain these rate increases. Folding rate enhancements are consistent with the goal to reduce sampling time necessary to reach native structures during folding simulations. As anticipated, not all constrained windows showed an equal decrease in folding time. We conclude by analyzing these differences and explain why RBD may be the preferred way to constrain structure.},

Accordingly, the energy landscape of a blocked peptide unit can be mapped in two dimensions, as shown by Ramachandran, Sasisekharan, and Ramakrishnan almost half a century ago. With atoms approximated as hard spheres, the eponymous Ramachandran plot demonstrated that steric clashes alone eliminate 3/4 of ϕ,$\psi$-space, a result that has guided all subsequent work. Here, we show that adding hydrogen-bonding constraints to these steric criteria eliminates another substantial region of ϕ,$\psi$-space for a blocked peptide; for conformers within this region, an amide hydrogen is solvent-inaccessible, depriving it of a hydrogen-bonding partner. Yet, this "forbidden" region is well populated in folded proteins, which can provide longer-range intramolecular hydrogen-bond partners for these otherwise unsatisfied polar groups. Consequently, conformational space expands under folding conditions, a paradigm-shifting realization that prompts an experimentally verifiable conjecture about likely folding pathways.},

abstract = {We present a method with the potential to generate a library of coil segments from first principles. Proteins are built from alpha-helices and/or beta-strands interconnected by these coil segments. Here, we investigate the conformational determinants of short coil segments, with particular emphasis on chain turns. Toward this goal, we extracted a comprehensive set of two-, three-, and four-residue turns from X-ray-elucidated proteins and classified them by conformation. A remarkably small number of unique conformers account for most of this experimentally determined set, whereas remaining members span a large number of rare conformers, many occurring only once in the entire protein database. Factors determining conformation were identified via Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations devised to test the effectiveness of various energy terms. Simulated structures were validated by comparison to experimental counterparts. After filtering rare conformers, we found that 98{\%} of the remaining experimentally determined turn population could be reproduced by applying a hydrogen bond energy term to an exhaustively generated ensemble of clash-free conformers in which no backbone polar group lacks a hydrogen-bond partner. Further, at least 90{\%} of longer coil segments, ranging from 5- to 20 residues, were found to be structural composites of these shorter primitives. These results are pertinent to protein structure prediction, where approaches can be divided into either empirical or ab initio methods. Empirical methods use database-derived information; ab initio methods rely on physical-chemical principles exclusively. Replacing the database-derived coil library with one generated from first principles would transform any empirically based method into its corresponding ab initio homologue.},

Simulations begin from a realistic unfolded state devoid of secondary structure and use a chain representation lacking explicit side chains, rendering the simulations many orders of magnitude faster than molecular dynamics simulations. The multiple round nature of the algorithm mimics the authentic folding process and tests the effectiveness of sequential stabilization (SS) as a search strategy wherein 2° structural elements add onto existing structures in a process of progressive learning and stabilization of structure found in prior rounds of folding. Because no a priori knowledge is used, we can identify kinetically significant non-native interactions and intermediates, sometimes generated by only two mutations, while the evolution of contact matrices is often consistent with experiments. Moreover, structure prediction improves substantially by incorporating information from prior rounds. The success of our simple, homology-free approach affirms the validity of our description of the primary determinants of folding pathways and structure, and the effectiveness of SS as a search strategy.},

abstract = {Since the demonstration that the sequence of a protein encodes its structure, the prediction of structure from sequence remains an outstanding problem that impacts numerous scientific disciplines, including many genome projects. By iteratively fixing secondary structure assignments of residues during Monte Carlo simulations of folding, our coarse-grained model without information concerning homology or explicit side chains can outperform current homology-based secondary structure prediction methods for many proteins. The computationally rapid algorithm using only single (phi,psi) dihedral angle moves also generates tertiary structures of accuracy comparable with existing all-atom methods for many small proteins, particularly those with low homology. Hence, given appropriate search strategies and scoring functions, reduced representations can be used for accurately predicting secondary structure and providing 3D structures, thereby increasing the size of proteins approachable by homology-free methods and the accuracy of template methods that depend on a high-quality input secondary structure.},

abstract = {The prediction of protein tertiary structure from sequence using molecular energy calculations has not yet been successful; an alternative strategy of recognizing known motifs or folds in sequences looks more promising. We present here a new approach to fold recognition, whereby sequences are fitted directly onto the backbone coordinates of known protein structures. Our method for protein fold recognition involves automatic modelling of protein structures using a given sequence, and is based on the frameworks of known protein folds. The plausibility of each model, and hence the degree of compatibility between the sequence and the proposed structure, is evaluated by means of a set of empirical potentials derived from proteins of known structure. The novel aspect of our approach is that the matching of sequences to backbone coordinates is performed in full three-dimensional space, incorporating specific pair interactions explicitly.},

abstract = {Comparative modeling predicts the three-dimensional structure of a given protein sequence (target) based primarily on its alignment to one or more proteins of known structure (templates). The prediction process consists of fold assignment, target-template alignment, model building, and model evaluation. The number of protein sequences that can be modeled and the accuracy of the predictions are increasing steadily because of the growth in the number of known protein structures and because of the improvements in the modeling software. Further advances are necessary in recognizing weak sequence-structure similarities, aligning sequences with structures, modeling of rigid body shifts, distortions, loops and side chains, as well as detecting errors in a model. Despite these problems, it is currently possible to model with useful accuracy significant parts of approximately one third of all known protein sequences. The use of individual comparative models in biology is already rewarding and increasingly widespread. A major new challenge for comparative modeling is the integration of it with the torrents of data from genome sequencing projects as well as from functional and structural genomics. In particular, there is a need to develop an automated, rapid, robust, sensitive, and accurate comparative modeling pipeline applicable to whole genomes. Such large-scale modeling is likely to encourage new kinds of applications for the many resulting models, based on their large number and completeness at the level of the family, organism, or functional network.},

@article{Csaba2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: SCOP and CATH are widely used as gold standards to benchmark novel protein structure comparison methods as well as to train machine learning approaches for protein structure classification and prediction. The two hierarchies result from different protocols which may result in differing classifications of the same protein. Ignoring such differences leads to problems when being used to train or benchmark automatic structure classification methods. Here, we propose a method to compare SCOP and CATH in detail and discuss possible applications of this analysis.

RESULTS: We create a new mapping between SCOP and CATH and define a consistent benchmark set which is shown to largely reduce errors made by structure comparison methods such as TM-Align and has useful further applications, e.g. for machine learning methods being trained for protein structure classification. Additionally, we extract additional connections in the topology of the protein fold space from the orthogonal features contained in SCOP and CATH.

CONCLUSION: Via an all-to-all comparison, we find that there are large and unexpected differences between SCOP and CATH w.r.t. their domain definitions as well as their hierarchic partitioning of the fold space on every level of the two classifications. A consistent mapping of SCOP and CATH can be exploited for automated structure comparison and classification.

AVAILABILITY: Benchmark sets and an interactive SCOP-CATH browser are available at http://www.bio.ifi.lmu.de/SCOPCath.},

@article{Honig1996,
abstract = {It is argued that the chemical nature of the polypeptide backbone is the central determinant of the three-dimensional structures of proteins. The requirement that buried polar groups form intramolecular hydrogen bonds limits the fold of the backbone to the well known units of secondary structure while the amino acid sequence chooses among the set of conformations available to the backbone. ‘Sidechain-only' models, based for example on hydrophobicity patterns, fail to account for the properties of the backbone and thus will have difficulty capturing essential features of a folding pathway. This is evident from the incorrect predictions they make for the conformations of the limiting cases of all-hydrophobic or all-polar sequences.},

abstract = {The poly-l-proline type II (PPII) helix in recent years has emerged clearly as a structural class not only of fibrillar proteins (in collagen, PPII is a dominant conformation) but also of the folded and unfolded proteins. Although much less abundant in folded proteins than the $\alpha$-helix and $\beta$-structure, the left-handed, extended PPII helix represents the only frequently occurring regular structure apart from these two structure classes. Natively unfolded proteins have a high content of the PPII helices identified by spectroscopic methods. Apart from the structural function, PPII is favorable for protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions and plays a major role in signal transduction and protein complex assembly, as this structure is often found in binding sites, specifically binding sites of widely spread SH3 domains. PPII helices do not necessarily contain proline, but proline has high PPII propensity. Commonly occurring proline-rich regions, serving as recognition sites, are likely to have PPII structure. PPII helices are involved in transcription, cell motility, self-assembly, elasticity, and bacterial and viral pathogenesis, and has an important structural role in amyloidogenic proteins. However, PPII helices are not always assigned in experimentally solved structures, and they are rarely used in protein structure modeling. We aim to give an overview of this structural class and of the place it holds in our current understanding of protein structure and function. This review is subdivided into three main parts: the first part covers PPII helices in unfolded peptides and proteins, the second part includes studies of the PPII helices in folded proteins, and the third part discusses the functional role of the PPII.},

abstract = {A central issue in protein folding is the degree to which each residue's backbone conformational preferences stabilize the native state. We have studied the conformational preferences of each amino acid when the amino acid is not constrained to be in a regular secondary structure. In this large but highly restricted coil library, the backbone preferentially adopts dihedral angles consistent with the polyproline II conformation rather than alpha or beta conformations. The preference for the polyproline II conformation is independent of the degree of solvation. In conjunction with a new masking procedure, the frequencies in our coil library accurately recapitulate both helix and sheet frequencies for the amino acids in structured regions, as well as polyproline II propensities. Therefore, structural propensities for alpha-helices and beta-sheets and for polyproline II conformations in unfolded peptides can be rationalized solely by local effects. In addition, these propensities are often strongly affected by both the chemical nature and the conformation of neighboring residues, contrary to the Flory isolated residue hypothesis.},

@article{Betancourt2004a,
abstract = {The following three issues concerning the backbone dihedral angles of protein structures are presented. (1) How do the dihedral angles of the 20 amino acids depend on the identity and conformation of their nearest residues? (2) To what extent are the native dihedral angles determined by local (dihedral) potentials? (3) How to build a knowledge-based potential for a residue's dihedral angles, considering the identity and conformation of its nearest residues? We find that the dihedral angle distribution for a residue can significantly depend on the identity and conformation of its adjacent residues. These correlations are in sharp contrast to the Flory isolated-pair hypothesis. Statistical potentials are built for all combinations of residue triplets and depend on the dihedral angles between consecutive residues. First, a low-resolution potential is obtained, which only differentiates between the main populated basins in the dihedral angle density plots. Minimization of the dihedral potential for 125 test proteins reveals that most native alpha-helical residues (89{\%}) and a large fraction of native beta-sheet residues (47{\%}) adopt conformations close to their native one. For native loop residues, the percentage is 48{\%}. It is also found that this fraction is higher for residues away from the ends of alpha or beta secondary structure elements. In addition, a higher resolution potential is built as a function of dihedral angles by a smoothing procedure and continuous functions interpolations. Monte Carlo energy minimization with this potential results in a lower fraction for native beta-sheet residues. Nevertheless, because of the higher flexibility and entropy of beta structures, they could be preferred under the influence of non-local interactions. In general, most alpha-helices and many beta-sheets are strongly determined by the local potential, while the conformations in loops and near the end of beta-sheets are more influenced by non-local interactions.},

@article{Abagyan1994,
abstract = {Two major components are required for a successful prediction of the three-dimensional structure of peptides and proteins: an efficient global optimization procedure which is capable of finding an appropriate local minimum for the strongly anisotropic function of hundreds of variables, and a set of free energy components for a protein molecule in solution which are computationally inexpensive enough to be used in the search procedure, yet sufficiently accurate to ensure the uniqueness of the native conformation. We here found an efficient way to make a random step in a Monte Carlo procedure given knowledge of the energy or statistical properties of conformational subspaces (e.g. phi-psi zones or side-chain torsion angles). This biased probability Monte Carlo (BPMC) procedure randomly selects the subspace first, then makes a step to a new random position independent of the previous position, but according to the predefined continuous probability distribution. The random step is followed by a local minimization in torsion angle space. The positions, sizes and preferences for high-probability zones on phi-psi maps and chi-angle maps were calculated for different residue types from the representative set of 191 and 161 protein 3D-structures, respectively. A fast and precise method to evaluate the electrostatic energy of a protein in solution is developed and combined with the BPMC procedure. The method is based on the modified spherical image charge approximation, efficiently projected onto a molecule of arbitrary shape. Comparison with the finite-difference solutions of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation shows high accuracy for our approach. The BPMC procedure is applied successfully to the structure prediction of 12- and 16-residue synthetic peptides and the determination of protein structure from NMR data, with the immunoglobulin binding domain of streptococcal protein G as an example. The BPMC runs display much better convergence properties than the non-biased simulations. The advantage of a true global optimization procedure for NMR structure determination is its ability to cope with local minima originating from data errors and ambiguities in NMR data.},

For selected fragments, up to 14 residues long, the lowest free energy structures produced by the GA are similar in conformation to the corresponding experimental structures in most cases. There are three main conclusions from these results. First, the genetic algorithm is an effective method for searching amongst the compact conformations of a polypeptide chain. Second, the free energy function is generally able to select native-like conformations. However, some deficiencies are identified, and further development is proposed. Third, the selection of native-like conformations for some protein fragments establishes that in these cases the conformation observed in the full protein structure is largely context independent.

abstract = {Much experimental work has been devoted in comparing the folding behavior of proteins sharing the same fold but different sequence. The recent design of proteins displaying very high sequence identities but different 3D structure allows the unique opportunity to address the protein-folding problem from a complementary perspective. Here we explored by $\Phi$-value analysis the pathways of folding of three different heteromorphic pairs, displaying increasingly high-sequence identity (namely, 30{\%}, 77{\%}, and 88{\%}), but different structures called G(A) (a 3-$\alpha$ helix fold) and G(B) (an $\alpha$/$\beta$ fold). The analysis, based on 132 site-directed mutants, is fully consistent with the idea that protein topology is committed very early along the pathway of folding. Furthermore, data reveals that when folding approaches a perfect two-state scenario, as in the case of the G(A) domains, the structural features of the transition state appear very robust to changes in sequence composition. On the other hand, when folding is more complex and multistate, as for the G(B)s, there are alternative nuclei or accessible pathways that can be alternatively stabilized by altering the primary structure. The implications of our results in the light of previous work on the folding of different members belonging to the same protein family are discussed.},

The history of the rate of discovery of new folds and the distribution of sequence families among known folds provide a means of estimating the underlying distribution of fold use. Previous models exploiting these data have led to rather different conclusions on the total number of folds. We present a new model, based on the notion that the folds used in biology fall naturally into three classes: unifolds, that is, folds found only in a single narrow sequence family; mesofolds, found in an intermediate number of families; and the previously noted superfolds, found in many protein families. We show that this model fits the available data well and has predicted the development of SCOP over the past 2 years. The principle implications of the model are as follows: (1) The vast majority of folds will be found in only a single sequence family; (2) the total number of folds is at least 10,000; and (3) 80{\%} of sequence families have one of about 400 folds, most of which are already known.},

abstract = {The classification of protein folds is necessarily based on the structural elements that distinguish domains. Classification of protein domains consists of two problems: the partition of structures into domains and the classification of domains into sets of similar structures (or folds). Although similar topologies may arise by convergent evolution, the similarity of their respective folding pathways is unknown. The discovery and the characterization of the majority of protein folds will be followed by a similar enumeration of available protein folding pathways. Consequently, understanding the intricacies of structural domains is necessary to understanding their collective folding pathways. We review the current state of the art in the field of protein domain classification and discuss methods for the systematic and comprehensive study of protein folding across protein fold space via atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. Finally, we discuss our large-scale Dynameomics project, which includes simulations of representatives of all autonomous protein folds.},

abstract = {Theoretical and experimental studies of protein folding have suggested that the topology of the native state may be the most important factor determining the folding pathway of a protein, independent of its specific amino acid sequence. To test this concept, many experimental studies have been carried out with the aim of comparing the folding pathways of proteins that possess similar tertiary structures, but divergent sequences. Many of these studies focus on quantitative comparisons of folding transition state structures, as determined by Phi(f) value analysis of folding kinetic data. In some of these studies, folding transition state structures are found to be highly conserved, whereas in others they are not. We conclude that folds displaying more conserved transition state structures may have the most restricted number of possible folding pathways and that folds displaying low transition state structural conservation possess many potential pathways for reaching the native state.},

abstract = {In the fifty years since the first atomic structure of a protein was revealed, tens of thousands of additional structures have been solved. Like all objects in biology, proteins structures show common patterns that seem to define family relationships. Classification of proteins structures, which started in the 1970s with about a dozen structures, has continued with increasing enthusiasm, leading to two main fold classifications, SCOP and CATH, as well as many additional databases. Classification is complicated by deciding what constitutes a domain, the fundamental unit of structure. Also difficult is deciding when two given structures are similar. Like all of biology, fold classification is beset by exceptions to all rules. Thus, the perspectives of protein fold space that the fold classifications offer differ from each other. In spite of these ambiguities, fold classifications are useful for prediction of structure and function. Studying the characteristics of fold space can shed light on protein evolution and the physical laws that govern protein behavior.},

In the first part of this article, we focus on a few reasons as to why the solution to the protein-folding problem (PFP) has been elusive for a very long time. One is a result of the misinterpretation of Anfinsen's Thermodynamic hypothesis which led to the conclusion that the native structure of a protein must be at a global minimum of the Gibbs energy. The second is the result of the adherence to the hydrophobic paradigm, and at the same time ignoring a whole repertoire of hydrophilic effects. It is argued that switching from a target-based to a caused-based approach, and adopting the hydrophilic paradigm leads straightforwardly to a simple answer to Levinthal's question, as well as to a solution of the PFP.},

abstract = {Models of protein energetics that neglect interactions between amino acids that are not adjacent in the native state, such as the Go model, encode or underlie many influential ideas on protein folding. Implicit in this simplification is a crucial assumption that has never been critically evaluated in a broad context: Detailed mechanisms of protein folding are not biased by nonnative contacts, typically argued to be a consequence of sequence design and/or topology. Here we present, using computer simulations of a well-studied lattice heteropolymer model, the first systematic test of this oft-assumed correspondence over the statistically significant range of hundreds of thousands of amino acid sequences that fold to the same native structure. Contrary to previous conjectures, we find a multiplicity of folding mechanisms, suggesting that Go-like models cannot be justified by considerations of topology alone. Instead, we find that the crucial factor in discriminating among topological pathways is the heterogeneity of native contact energies: The order in which native contacts accumulate is profoundly insensitive to omission of nonnative interactions, provided that native contact heterogeneity is retained. This robustness holds over a surprisingly wide range of folding rates for our designed sequences. Mirroring predictions based on the principle of minimum frustration, fast-folding sequences match their Go-like counterparts in both topological mechanism and transit times. Less optimized sequences dwell much longer in the unfolded state and/or off-pathway intermediates than do Go-like models. For dynamics that bridge unfolded and unfolded states, however, even slow folders exhibit topological mechanisms and transit times nearly identical with those of their Go-like counterparts. Our results do not imply a direct correspondence between folding trajectories of Go-like models and those of real proteins, but they do help to clarify key topological and energetic assumptions that are commonly used to justify such caricatures.},

@article{Le2009,
abstract = {Finding structural similarities between proteins often helps reveal shared functionality, which otherwise might not be detected by native sequence information alone. Such similarity is usually detected and quantified by protein structure alignment. Determining the optimal alignment between two protein structures, however, remains a hard problem. An alternative approach is to approximate each three-dimensional protein structure using a sequence of motifs derived from a structural alphabet. Using this approach, structure comparison is performed by comparing the corresponding motif sequences or structural sequences. In this article, we measure the performance of such alphabets in the context of the protein structure classification problem. We consider both local and global structural sequences. Each letter of a local structural sequence corresponds to the best matching fragment to the corresponding local segment of the protein structure. The global structural sequence is designed to generate the best possible complete chain that matches the full protein structure. We use an alphabet of 20 letters, corresponding to a library of 20 motifs or protein fragments having four residues. We show that the global structural sequences approximate well the native structures of proteins, with an average coordinate root mean square of 0.69 A over 2225 test proteins. The approximation is best for all alpha-proteins, while relatively poorer for all beta-proteins. We then test the performance of four different sequence representations of proteins (their native sequence, the sequence of their secondary-structure elements, and the local and global structural sequences based on our fragment library) with different classifiers in their ability to classify proteins that belong to five distinct folds of CATH. Without surprise, the primary sequence alone performs poorly as a structure classifier. We show that addition of either secondary-structure information or local information from the structural sequence considerably improves the classification accuracy. The two fragment-based sequences perform better than the secondary-structure sequence but not well enough at this stage to be a viable alternative to more computationally intensive methods based on protein structure alignment.},

abstract = {An important puzzle in structural biology is the question of how proteins are able to fold so quickly into their unique native structures. There is much evidence that protein folding is hierarchic. In that case, folding routes are not linear, but have a tree structure. Trees are commonly used to represent the grammatical structure of natural language sentences, and chart parsing algorithms efficiently search the space of all possible trees for a given input string. Here we show that one such method, the CKY algorithm, can be useful both for providing novel insight into the physical protein folding process, and for computational protein structure prediction. As proof of concept, we apply this algorithm to the HP lattice model of proteins. Our algorithm identifies all direct folding route trees to the native state and allows us to construct a simple model of the folding process. Despite its simplicity, our model provides an account for the fact that folding rates depend only on the topology of the native state but not on sequence composition.},

@article{Voelz2007,
abstract = {It has been proposed that proteins fold by a process called "Zipping and Assembly" (Z{\&}A). Zipping refers to the growth of local substructures within the chain, and assembly refers to the coming together of already-formed pieces. Our interest here is in whether Z{\&}A is a general method that can fold most of sequence space, to global minima, efficiently. Using the HP model, we can address this question by enumerating full conformation and sequence spaces. We find that Z{\&}A reaches the global energy minimum native states, even though it searches only a very small fraction of conformational space, for most sequences in the full sequence space. We find that Z{\&}A, a mechanism-based search, is more efficient in our tests than the replica exchange search method. Folding efficiency is increased for chains having: (a) small loop-closure steps, consistent with observations by Plaxco et al. 1998;277;985-994 that folding rates correlate with contact order, (b) neither too few nor too many nucleation sites per chain, and (c) assembly steps that do not occur too early in the folding process. We find that the efficiency increases with chain length, although our range of chain lengths is limited. We believe these insights may be useful for developing faster protein conformational search algorithms.},

abstract = {How do proteins fold so quickly? Some denatured proteins fold to their native structures in only microseconds, on average, implying that there is a folding "mechanism," i.e., a particular set of events by which the protein short-circuits a broader conformational search. Predicting protein structures using atomically detailed physical models is currently challenging. The most definitive proof of a putative folding mechanism would be whether it speeds up protein structure prediction in physical models. In the zipping and assembly (ZA) mechanism, local structuring happens first at independent sites along the chain, then those structures either grow (zip) or coalescence (assemble) with other structures. Here, we apply the ZA search mechanism to protein native structure prediction by using the AMBER96 force field with a generalized Born/surface area implicit solvent model and sampling by replica exchange molecular dynamics. Starting from open denatured conformations, our algorithm, called the ZA method, converges to an average of 2.2 A from the Protein Data Bank native structures of eight of nine proteins that we tested, which ranged from 25 to 73 aa in length. In addition, experimental Phi values, where available on these proteins, are consistent with the predicted routes. We conclude that ZA is a viable model for how proteins physically fold. The present work also shows that physics-based force fields are quite good and that physics-based protein structure prediction may be practical, at least for some small proteins.},

Based on the Wang-Landau algorithm, the complete free energy landscape for the designed sequence 2DX4: INYWLAHAKAGYIVHWTA is constructed. It is shown that 2DX4 possesses two nearly degenerate native structures: one is a helix structure with the other a hairpinlike structure, and their free energy difference is {\textless}2{\%} of that of local minima. Two degenerate native structures are stabilized by an energy barrier of ∼10 kcal/mol. Furthermore, the hydrogen-bond and dipole-dipole interactions are found to be two major competing interactions in transforming one conformation into the other. Our results indicate that two degenerate native structures are stabilized by subtle balance between different interactions in proteins. In particular, for small proteins, balance between the hydrogen-bond and dipole-dipole interactions happens for proteins of sizes being ∼18 amino acids and is shown to the main driving mechanism for the occurrence of degeneracy. These results provide important clues to the study of native structures of proteins.},

To examine the extent to which non-local factors influence the formation of secondary structural elements, we have designed an 11-amino-acid sequence (dubbed the 'chameleon' sequence) that folds as an alpha-helix when in one position but as a beta-sheet when in another position of the primary sequence of the IgG-binding domain of protein G (GB1). Both proteins, chameleon-alpha and chameleon-beta, are folded into structures similar to native GB1, as judged by several biophysical criteria. Our results demonstrate that non-local interactions can determine the secondary structure of peptide sequences of substantial length.

abstract = {Globular proteins are assemblies of alpha-helices and beta-strands, interconnected by reverse turns and longer loops. Most short turns can be classified readily into a limited repertoire of discrete backbone conformations, but the physical-chemical determinants of these distinct conformational basins remain an open question. We investigated this question by exhaustive analysis of all backbone conformations accessible to short chain segments bracketed by either an alpha-helix or a beta-strand (i.e., alpha-segment-alpha, beta-segment-beta, alpha-segment-beta, and beta-segment-alpha) in a nine-state model. We find that each of these four secondary structure environments imposes its own unique steric and hydrogen-bonding constraints on the intervening segment, resulting in a limited repertoire of conformations. In greater detail, an exhaustive set of conformations was generated for short backbone segments having reverse-turn chain topology and bracketed between elements of secondary structure. This set was filtered, and only clash-free, hydrogen-bond-satisfied conformers having reverse-turn topology were retained. The filtered set includes authentic turn conformations, observed in proteins of known structure, but little else. In particular, over 99{\%} of the alternative conformations failed to satisfy at least one criterion and were excluded from the filtered set. Furthermore, almost all of the remaining alternative conformations have close tolerances that would be too tight to accommodate side chains longer than a single beta-carbon. These results provide a molecular explanation for the observation that reverse turns between elements of regular secondary can be classified into a small number of discrete conformations.},

To explore this question, backbone dihedral angles were extracted from the known three-dimensional structure of 2,439 proteins and mapped into 36 labeled, 60 degrees x 60 degrees bins, called mesostates. Using this coarse-grained mapping, protein conformation can be approximated by a linear sequence of mesostates. These linear strings can then be aligned and assessed by conventional sequence-comparison methods.

abstract = {Here, we compare the distributions of main chain (Phi,Psi) angles (i.e., Ramachandran maps) of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids in three contexts: (i) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Gly-Gly-X-Gly-Gly pentapeptides in water at 298 K with exhaustive sampling, where X = the amino acid in question; (ii) 188 independent protein simulations in water at 298 K from our Dynameomics Project; and (iii) static crystal and NMR structures from the Protein Data Bank. The GGXGG peptide series is often used as a model of the unstructured denatured state of proteins. The sampling in the peptide MD simulations is neither random nor uniform. Instead, individual amino acids show preferences for particular conformations, but the peptide is dynamic, and interconversion between conformers is facile. For a given amino acid, the (Phi,Psi) distributions in the protein simulations and the Protein Data Bank are very similar and often distinct from those in the peptide simulations. Comparison between the peptide and protein simulations shows that packing constraints, solvation, and the tendency for particular amino acids to be used for specific structural motifs can overwhelm the "intrinsic propensities" of amino acids for particular (Phi,Psi) conformations. We also compare our helical propensities with experimental consensus values using the host-guest method, which appear to be determined largely by context and not necessarily the intrinsic conformational propensities of the guest residues. These simulations represent an improved coil library free from contextual effects to better model intrinsic conformational propensities and provide a detailed view of conformations making up the "random coil" state.},

abstract = {Much attention is being paid to protein databases as an important information source for proteome research. Although used extensively for similarity searches, protein databases themselves have not fully been characterized. In a systematic attempt to reveal protein-database characters that could contribute to revealing how protein chains are constructed, frequency distributions of all possible combinatorial sets of three, four, and five amino acids ("triplets," "quartets," and "pentats"; collectively called constituent sequences) have been examined in the nonredundant (nr) protein database, demonstrating the existence of nonrandom bias in their "availability" at the population level. Nonexistent short sequences of pentats were found that showed low availability in biological proteins against their expected probabilities of occurrence. Among them, six representative ones were successfully synthesized as peptides with reasonably high yields in a conventional Fmoc method, excluding the possibility that a putative physicochemical energy barrier in forming them could be a direct cause for the low availability. They were also expressed as soluble fusion proteins in a conventional Escherichia coli BL21Star(DE3) system with reasonably high yield, again excluding a possible difficulty in their biological synthesis. Together, these results suggest that information on three-dimensional structures and functions of proteins exists in the context of connections of short constituent sequences, and that proteins are composed of evolutionarily selected constituent sequences, which are reflected in their availability differences in the database. These results may have biological implications for protein structural studies.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of protein secondary structure is essential for accurate sequence alignment, three-dimensional structure modeling, and function prediction. The accuracy of ab initio secondary structure prediction from sequence, however, has only increased from around 77 to 80{\%} over the past decade. Here, we developed a multistep neural-network algorithm by coupling secondary structure prediction with prediction of solvent accessibility and backbone torsion angles in an iterative manner. Our method called SPINE X was applied to a dataset of 2640 proteins (25{\%} sequence identity cutoff) previously built for the first version of SPINE and achieved a 82.0{\%} accuracy based on 10-fold cross validation (Q(3)). Surpassing 81{\%} accuracy by SPINE X is further confirmed by employing an independently built test dataset of 1833 protein chains, a recently built dataset of 1975 proteins and 117 CASP 9 targets (critical assessment of structure prediction techniques) with an accuracy of 81.3{\%}, 82.3{\%} and 81.8{\%}, respectively. The prediction accuracy is further improved to 83.8{\%} for the dataset of 2640 proteins if the DSSP assignment used above is replaced by a more consistent consensus secondary structure assignment method. Comparison to the popular PSIPRED and CASP-winning structure-prediction techniques is made. SPINE X predicts number of helices and sheets correctly for 21.0{\%} of 1833 proteins, compared to 17.6{\%} by PSIPRED. It further shows that SPINE X consistently makes more accurate prediction in helical residues (6{\%}) without over prediction while PSIPRED makes more accurate prediction in coil residues (3-5{\%}) and over predicts them by 7{\%}.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hydrophobic Cluster Analysis (HCA) is an efficient way to compare highly divergent sequences through the implicit secondary structure information directly derived from hydrophobic clusters. However, its efficiency and application are currently limited by the need of user expertise. In order to help the analysis of HCA plots, we report here the structural preferences of hydrophobic cluster species, which are frequently encountered in globular domains of proteins. These species are characterized only by their hydrophobic/non-hydrophobic dichotomy. This analysis has been extended to loop-forming clusters, using an appropriate loop alphabet.

RESULTS: The structural behavior of hydrophobic cluster species, which are typical of protein globular domains, was investigated within banks of experimental structures, considered at different levels of sequence redundancy. The 294 more frequent hydrophobic cluster species were analyzed with regard to their association with the different secondary structures (frequencies of association with secondary structures and secondary structure propensities). Hydrophobic cluster species are predominantly associated with regular secondary structures, and a large part (60 {\%}) reveals preferences for alpha-helices or beta-strands. Moreover, the analysis of the hydrophobic cluster amino acid composition generally allows for finer prediction of the regular secondary structure associated with the considered cluster within a cluster species. We also investigated the behavior of loop forming clusters, using a "PGDNS" alphabet. These loop clusters do not overlap with hydrophobic clusters and are highly associated with coils. Finally, the structural information contained in the hydrophobic structural words, as deduced from experimental structures, was compared to the PSI-PRED predictions, revealing that beta-strands and especially alpha-helices are generally over-predicted within the limits of typical beta and alpha hydrophobic clusters.

CONCLUSION: The dictionary of hydrophobic clusters described here can help the HCA user to interpret and compare the HCA plots of globular protein sequences, as well as provides an original fundamental insight into the structural bricks of protein folds. Moreover, the novel loop cluster analysis brings additional information for secondary structure prediction on the whole sequence through a generalized cluster analysis (GCA), and not only on regular secondary structures. Such information lays the foundations for developing a new and original tool for secondary structure prediction.},

abstract = {The Gaussian-distributed random coil has been the dominant model for denatured proteins since the 1950s, and it has long been interpreted to mean that proteins are featureless, statistical coils in 6 M guanidinium chloride. Here, we demonstrate that random-coil statistics are not a unique signature of featureless polymers. The random-coil model does predict the experimentally determined coil dimensions of denatured proteins successfully. Yet, other equally convincing experiments have shown that denatured proteins are biased toward specific conformations, in apparent conflict with the random-coil model. We seek to resolve this paradox by introducing a contrived counterexample in which largely native protein ensembles nevertheless exhibit random-coil characteristics. Specifically, proteins of known structure were used to generate disordered conformers by varying backbone torsion angles at random for approximately 8{\%} of the residues; the remaining approximately 92{\%} of the residues remained fixed in their native conformation. Ensembles of these disordered structures were generated for 33 proteins by using a torsion-angle Monte Carlo algorithm with hard-sphere sterics; bulk statistics were then calculated for each ensemble. Despite this extreme degree of imposed internal structure, these ensembles have end-to-end distances and mean radii of gyration that agree well with random-coil expectations in all but two cases.},

Instead, such groups are often capped by alternative hydrogen bond partners. This review enlarges our earlier hypothesis (Presta LG, Rose GD. 1988. Helix signals in proteins.

From a global survey among proteins of known structure, seven distinct capping motifs are identified-three at the helix N-terminus and four at the C-terminus. The consensus sequence patterns of these seven motifs, together with results from simple molecular modeling, are used to formulate useful rules of thumb for helix termination.

Addition of organic osmolytes, small uncharged compounds found throughout nature, shift this equilibrium.

Using the Tanford Transfer Model, the thermodynamic response to many such osmolytes has been dissected into groupwise free energy contributions.

abstract = {In recent host-guest studies, the helix-forming tendencies of amino acid residues have been quantified by three groups, each obtaining similar results [Padmanabhan, S., Marqusee, S., Ridgeway, T., Laue, T. M. {\&} Baldwin, R. L. (1990) Nature (London) 344, 268-270; O'Neil, K. T. {\&} DeGrado, W. F. (1990) Science 250, 646-651; Lyu, P. C., Liff, M. I., Marky, L. A. {\&} Kallenbach, N. R. (1990) Science 250, 669-673]. Here, we explore the hypothesis that these measured helix-forming propensities are due primarily to conformational restrictions imposed upon residue side chains by the helix itself. This proposition is tested by calculating the extent to which the bulky helix backbone "freezes out" available degrees of freedom in helix side chains. Specifically, for a series of apolar residues, the difference in configurational entropy, delta S, between each side chain in the unfolded state and in the alpha-helical state is obtained from a simple Monte Carlo calculation. These computed entropy differences are then compared with the experimentally determined values. Measured and calculated values are found to be in close agreement for naturally occurring amino acids and in total disagreement for non-natural amino acids. In the calculation, delta S(Ala) = 0. The rank order of entropy loss for the series of natural apolar side chains under consideration is Ala less than Leu less than Trp less than Met less than Phe less than Ile less than Tyr less than Val. Among these, none favor helix formation; Ala is neutral, and all remaining residues are unfavorable to varying degrees. Thus, applied to side chains, the term "helix preference" is a misnomer. While side chain-side chain interactions may modulate stability in some instances, our results indicate that the drive to form helices must originate in the backbone, consistent with Pauling's view of four decades ago [Pauling, L., Corey, R. B. {\&} Branson, H. R. (1951) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 37, 205-210].},

The algorithm, which has been implemented in a computer program, was applied to large, overlapping fragments from a diverse test set of 7 X-ray-elucidated proteins, with encouraging results. For all proteins but one, the overall fragment topology is well predicted, including both secondary and supersecondary structure. The algorithm was also applied to a molecule of unknown conformation, groES, in which X-ray structure determination is presently ongoing. LINUS is an acronym for Local Independently Nucleated Units of Structure. The procedure ascends the folding hierarchy in discrete stages, with concomitant accretion of structure at each step. The chain is represented by simplified geometry and folds under the influence of a primitive energy function. The only accurately described energetic quantity in this work is hard sphere repulsion--the principal force involved in organizing protein conformation [Richards, F. M. Ann. Rev. Biophys.

We found that a central residue in a helical peptide cannot adopt dihedral angles from strand regions without encountering a steric collision. Consequently, an alpha-helical segment followed by a beta-strand segment must be connected by an intervening linker. This restriction was validated both by simulations and by seeking violations within proteins of known structure. In fact, no violations were found within an extensive database of high-resolution X-ray structures. Nature's exclusion of alpha-beta hybrid segments, fashioned from an alpha-helix adjoined to a beta-strand, is built into proteins at the covalent level. This straightforward conformational constraint has far-reaching consequences in organizing unfolded proteins and limiting the number of possible protein domains.},

abstract = {Reconstructing a protein in three dimensions from its backbone torsion angles is an ongoing challenge because minor inaccuracies in these angles produce major errors in the structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm, the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Even accurate knowledge of the backbone torsions and Psi is insufficient, owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, also lead to major errors in the structure. Against this background, we conducted a computational experiment to assess whether protein conformation can be determined from highly approximate backbone torsion angles, the kind of information that is now obtained readily from NMR. Specifically, backbone torsion angles were taken from proteins of known structure and mapped into 60 degrees x 60 degrees grid squares, called mesostates. Side-chain atoms beyond the beta -carbon were discarded. A mesostate representation of the protein backbone was then used to extract likely candidates from a fragment library of mesostate pentamers, followed by Monte Carlo-based fragment-assembly simulations to identify stable conformations compatible with the given mesostate sequence. Only three simple energy terms were used to gauge stability: molecular compaction, soft-sphere repulsion, and hydrogen bonding. For the six representative proteins described here, stable conformers can be partitioned into a remarkably small number of topologically distinct clusters. Among these, the native topology is found with high frequency and can be identified as the cluster with the most favorable energy.},

Accordingly, the energy landscape of a blocked peptide unit can be mapped in two dimensions, as shown by Ramachandran, Sasisekharan, and Ramakrishnan almost half a century ago. With atoms approximated as hard spheres, the eponymous Ramachandran plot demonstrated that steric clashes alone eliminate 3/4 of ϕ,$\psi$-space, a result that has guided all subsequent work. Here, we show that adding hydrogen-bonding constraints to these steric criteria eliminates another substantial region of ϕ,$\psi$-space for a blocked peptide; for conformers within this region, an amide hydrogen is solvent-inaccessible, depriving it of a hydrogen-bonding partner. Yet, this "forbidden" region is well populated in folded proteins, which can provide longer-range intramolecular hydrogen-bond partners for these otherwise unsatisfied polar groups. Consequently, conformational space expands under folding conditions, a paradigm-shifting realization that prompts an experimentally verifiable conjecture about likely folding pathways.},

abstract = {How does a folding protein negotiate a vast, featureless conformational landscape and adopt its native structure in biological real time? Motivated by this search problem, we developed a novel algorithm to compare protein structures. Procedures to identify structural analogs are typically conducted in three-dimensional space: the tertiary structure of a target protein is matched against each candidate in a database of structures, and goodness of fit is evaluated by a distance-based measure, such as the root-mean-square distance between target and candidate. This is an expensive approach because three-dimensional space is complex. Here, we transform the problem into a simpler one-dimensional procedure. Specifically, we identify and label the 11 most populated residue basins in a database of high-resolution protein structures. Using this 11-letter alphabet, any protein's three-dimensional structure can be transformed into a one-dimensional string by mapping each residue onto its corresponding basin. Similarity between the resultant basin strings can then be evaluated by conventional sequence-based comparison. The disorder → order folding transition is abridged on both sides. At the onset, folding conditions necessitate formation of hydrogen-bonded scaffold elements on which proteins are assembled, severely restricting the magnitude of accessible conformational space. Near the end, chain topology is established prior to emergence of the close-packed native state. At this latter stage of folding, the chain remains molten, and residues populate natural basins that are approximated by the 11 basins derived here. In essence, our algorithm reduces the protein-folding search problem to mapping the amino acid sequence onto a restricted basin string.},

It has been a long-standing open question whether such information is sufficient to determine a protein's fold. Indeed, even the far simpler problem of reconstructing the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its exact backbone torsion angles has remained a difficult challenge owing to the small, but cumulative, deviations from ideality in backbone planarity, which, if ignored, cause large errors in structure. As a familiar example, a small change in an elbow angle causes a large displacement at the end of your arm; the longer the arm, the larger the displacement. Here, correct secondary structure assignments (alpha-helix, beta-strand, beta-turn, polyproline II, coil) were used to constrain polypeptide backbone chains devoid of side chains, and the most stable folded conformations were determined, using Monte Carlo simulation. Just three terms were used to assess stability: molecular compaction, steric exclusion, and hydrogen bonding. For nine of the 13 proteins, this protocol restricts the main chain to a surprisingly small number of energetically favorable topologies, with the native one prominent among them.},

abstract = {Under physiological conditions, a protein undergoes a spontaneous disorder order transition called "folding." The protein polymer is highly flexible when unfolded but adopts its unique native, three-dimensional structure when folded. Current experimental knowledge comes primarily from thermodynamic measurements in solution or the structures of individual molecules, elucidated by either x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. From the former, we know the enthalpy, entropy, and free energy differences between the folded and unfolded forms of hundreds of proteins under a variety of solvent/cosolvent conditions. From the latter, we know the structures of approximately 35,000 proteins, which are built on scaffolds of hydrogen-bonded structural elements, alpha-helix and beta-sheet. Anfinsen showed that the amino acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine a protein's structure, but the molecular mechanism responsible for self-assembly remains an open question, probably the most fundamental open question in biochemistry. This perspective is a hybrid: partly review, partly proposal. First, we summarize key ideas regarding protein folding developed over the past half-century and culminating in the current mindset. In this view, the energetics of side-chain interactions dominate the folding process, driving the chain to self-organize under folding conditions. Next, having taken stock, we propose an alternative model that inverts the prevailing side-chain/backbone paradigm. Here, the energetics of backbone hydrogen bonds dominate the folding process, with preorganization in the unfolded state. Then, under folding conditions, the resultant fold is selected from a limited repertoire of structural possibilities, each corresponding to a distinct hydrogen-bonded arrangement of alpha-helices and/or strands of beta-sheet.},

We present a novel approach capable of reconstructing $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets in atomic detail. The method is based on Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations in a force field of empirical potentials that are designed to stabilize secondary structure elements in room-temperature simulations. Particular attention is paid to lateral side-chain interactions in $\beta$-sheets and between the turns of $\alpha$-helices, as well as backbone hydrogen bonding. The force constants are optimized using contrastive divergence, a novel machine learning technique, from a data set of known structures. Using this approach, we demonstrate the applicability of the framework to the problem of reconstructing the overall protein fold for a number of commonly studied small proteins, based on only predicted secondary structure and contact map. For protein G and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, we are able to reconstruct the secondary structure elements in atomic detail and the overall protein folds with a root mean-square deviation of {\textless}10 {\AA}. For cold-shock protein and the SH3 domain, we accurately reproduce the secondary structure elements and the topology of the 5-stranded $\beta$-sheets, but not the barrel structure.

abstract = {In protein fold recognition, a probe amino acid sequence is compared to a library of representative folds of known structure to identify a structural homolog. In cases where the probe and its homolog have clear sequence similarity, traditional residue substitution matrices have been used to predict the structural similarity. In cases where the probe is sequentially distant from its homolog, we have developed a (7 × 3 × 2 × 7 × 3) 3D-1D substitution matrix (called H3P2), calculated from a database of 119 structural pairs. Members of each pair share a similar fold, but have sequence identity less than 30{\%}. Each probe sequence position is defined by one of seven residue classes and three secondary structure classes. Each homologous fold position is defined by one of seven residue classes, three secondary structure classes, and two burial classes. Thus the matrix is five-dimensional and contains 7 × 3 × 2 × 7 × 3=882 elements or 3D-1D scores. The first step in assigning a probe sequence to its homologous fold is the prediction of the three-state (helix, strand, coil) secondary structure of the probe; here we use the profile based neural network prediction of secondary structure (PHD) program. Then a dynamic programming algorithm uses the H3P2 matrix to align the probe sequence with structures in a representative fold library. To test the effectiveness of the H3P2 matrix a challenging, fold class diverse, and cross-validated benchmark assessment is used to compare the H3P2 matrix to the GONNET, PAM250, BLOSUM62 and a secondary structure only substitution matrix. For distantly related sequences the H3P2 matrix detects more homologous structures at higher reliabilities than do these other substitution matrices, based on sensitivity versus specificity plots (or SENS-SPEC plots). The added efficacy of the H3P2 matrix arises from its information on the statistical preferences for various sequence-structure environment combinations from very distantly related proteins. It introduces the predicted secondary structure information from a sequence into fold recognition in a statistical way that normalizes the inherent correlations between residue type, secondary structure and solvent accessibility.},

abstract = {The ensemble folding of two 21-residue alpha-helical peptides has been studied using all-atom simulations under several variants of the AMBER potential in explicit solvent using a global distributed computing network. Our extensive sampling, orders of magnitude greater than the experimental folding time, results in complete convergence to ensemble equilibrium. This allows for a quantitative assessment of these potentials, including a new variant of the AMBER-99 force field, denoted AMBER-99 phi, which shows improved agreement with experimental kinetic and thermodynamic measurements. From bulk analysis of the simulated AMBER-99 phi equilibrium, we find that the folding landscape is pseudo-two-state, with complexity arising from the broad, shallow character of the "native" and "unfolded" regions of the phase space. Each of these macrostates allows for configurational diffusion among a diverse ensemble of conformational microstates with greatly varying helical content and molecular size. Indeed, the observed structural dynamics are better represented as a conformational diffusion than as a simple exponential process, and equilibrium transition rates spanning several orders of magnitude are reported. After multiple nucleation steps, on average, helix formation proceeds via a kinetic "alignment" phase in which two or more short, low-entropy helical segments form a more ideal, single-helix structure.},

abstract = {The information about the conformational behavior of monomeric helical peptides in solution, as well as the $\alpha$-helix stability in proteins, has been previously utilized to derive a database with the energy contributions for various interactions taking place in an $\alpha$-helix: intrinsic helical propensities, side-chain-side-chain interactions, main-chain-main-chain hydrogen bonds, and capping effects. This database was implemented in an algorithm based on the helix/coil transition theory (AGADIR). Here, we have modified this algorithm to include previously described local motifs: hydrophobic staple, Schellman motif and Pro-capping motif, new variants of these, and newly described side-chain-side-chain interactions. Based on recent experimental data we have introduced a position dependence of the helical propensities for some of the 20 amino acid residues. A new electrostatic model that takes into consideration all electrostatic interactions up to 12 residues in distance in the helix and random-coil conformations, as well as the effect of ionic strength, has been implemented. We have synthesized and analyzed several peptides, and used data from peptides already analysed by other groups, to test the validity of our electrostatic model. The modified algorithm predicts, with an overall standard deviation value of 6.6 (maximum helix is 100{\%}), the helical, content of 778 peptides of which 223 correspond to wild-type and modified protein fragments. To improve the prediction potential of the algorithm and to have a direct comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance data, the algorithm now predicts the conformational shift of the C$\alpha$H protons,13C$\alpha$ and 3J$\alpha$N values. We have found that for those peptides correctly predicted from the point of view of circular dichroism, the prediction of the NMR parameters is very good.},

abstract = {Until now and based on the success of the helix/coil transition theory it has been assumed that the $\alpha$-helical propensities of the amino acids are position independent. This has been critical to derive the set of theoretical parameters for the 20 natural amino acids. Here, we have analyzed the behavior of several non-polar residues, Val, Ile, Leu, Met and Gly at the N-cap, at each position of the first helical turn and at a central helical position of a 16-residue peptide model system that starts with eight consecutive alanine residues. We have interpreted the results from these experiments with the model of the helix/coil transition (AGADIR), that indicates that the intrinsic helical propensity is position dependent. Gly, Val and Ile are more favorable at the first turn than in the middle of the $\alpha$-helix, while for Leu and Met we observe the opposite behavior. The differences between the observed helical propensities are as large as 1.0 kcal/mol in some cases. Molecular modeling calculations using the ECEPP/2 force-field equipped with a hydration potential show that this effect can be explained by the combination of three factors: (a) the side-chains in the first helix turn are more solvent-exposed; (b) they have fewer intramolecular van der Waals' contacts; and (c) they posses higher configurational entropy than that in the central position of an $\alpha$-helix. The position-dependent results of the calculations are in reasonable agreement with the experimental estimates and with the intrinsic propensities of the amino acids derived from the statistical analysis of the protein structure database.},

In the accompanying paper the information about the conformational behaviour of helical peptides in solution, as well as the studies on alpha-helix stability in proteins has been utilised to derive a database of energy interactions. This database, when implemented in an algorithm based on the helix-coil transition theory (AGADIR), correctly calculates the average helical behaviour in solution of 423 peptides analysed by circular dichroism. The majority of these peptides have been studied at low temperatures (0 to 10 degrees C), and neutral pH. However, in vivo, proteins fold at higher temperatures and in some cases low or high pH values. To understand protein folding it is necessary to calculate the helical behaviour of linear peptides under very different temperature and pH experimental conditions. We have included the temperature and pH effects on the helical behaviour of peptides by means of generally accepted assumptions and simplifications. The inclusion of these terms allow us to calculate the helical behaviour of polyalanine-based peptides, as well as of complex natural sequences, under different experimental conditions.},

The information about the conformational behaviour of helical peptides in solution, as well as the alpha-helix stability in proteins, has been utilised to derive a database with the energy contributions for various interaction taking place in an alpha-helix: intrinsic helical propensities, side-chain to side-chain interactions, main-chain to main-chain hydrogen bonds, and capping effects. This database was implemented in a algorithm based on the helix-coil transition theory (AGADIR). Here, the effects on helix stability due to interactions between charged groups and the helix macrodipole are described, quantified and implemented in AGADIR. The algorithm correctly calculates the average helical behaviour in solution of 423 peptides analysed by circular dichroism and it describes the helicity at a residue level, as found when comparing the prediction for each amino acid residue with the data derived from nuclear magnetic resonance studies. Using AGADIR we have done a rational modification of peptides corresponding to protein secondary structure elements in order to increase their helical content. The circular dichroism analysis of the mutant peptides showed a very good agreement between the experimental and calculated helical content. Moreover, in certain specific cases in which strong tertiary contacts in folded proteins do not exist, the algorithm successfully predicts the length of mutagenised alpha-helices. It is interesting to note that the final values of the parameters used do not significantly differ in absolute terms from those extracted from mutagenesis studies in proteins. This indicates that the same physico-chemical principles stand for both systems.},

This database was implemented in an algorithm based on the helix/coil transition theory (AGADIR). Here, we have modified this algorithm to include previously described local motifs: hydrophobic staple, Schellman motif and Pro-capping motif, new variants of these, and newly described side-chain-side-chain interactions. Based on recent experimental data we have introduced a position dependence of the helical propensities for some of the 20 amino acid residues. A new electrostatic model that takes into consideration all electrostatic interactions up to 12 residues in distance in the helix and random-coil conformations, as well as the effect of ionic strength, has been implemented. We have synthesized and analyzed several peptides, and used data from peptides already analysed by other groups, to test the validity of our electrostatic model. The modified algorithm predicts, with an overall standard deviation value of 6.6 (maximum helix is 100{\%}), the helical, content of 778 peptides of which 223 correspond to wild-type and modified protein fragments. To improve the prediction potential of the algorithm and to have a direct comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance data, the algorithm now predicts the conformational shift of the CalphaH protons, 13Calpha and 3JalphaN values. We have found that for those peptides correctly predicted from the point of view of circular dichroism, the prediction of the NMR parameters is very good.},

abstract = {A deep understanding of protein structure benefits from the use of a variety of classification strategies that enhance our ability to effectively describe local patterns of conformation. Here, we use a clustering algorithm to analyze 76,533 all-trans segments from protein structures solved at 1.2 {\AA} resolution or better to create a purely $\phi$,$\psi$-based comprehensive empirical categorization of common conformations adopted by two adjacent $\phi$,$\psi$ pairs (i.e., ($\phi$,$\psi$)(2) motifs). The clustering algorithm works in an origin-shifted four-dimensional space based on the two $\phi$,$\psi$ pairs to yield a parameter-dependent list of ($\phi$,$\psi$)(2) motifs, in order of their prominence. The results are remarkably distinct from and complementary to the standard hydrogen-bond-centered view of secondary structure. New insights include an unprecedented level of precision in describing the $\phi$,$\psi$ angles of both previously known and novel motifs, ordering of these motifs by their population density, a data-driven recommendation that the standard C($\alpha$(i)){\ldots}C($\alpha$(i+3)){\textless}7 {\AA} criteria for defining turns be changed to 6.5 {\AA}, identification of $\beta$-strand and turn capping motifs, and identification of conformational capping by residues in polypeptide II conformation. We further document that the conformational preferences of a residue are substantially influenced by the conformation of its neighbors, and we suggest that accounting for these dependencies will improve protein modeling accuracy. Although the CUEVAS-4D(r(10)є(14)) 'parts list' presented here is only an initial exploration of the complex ($\phi$,$\psi$)(2) landscape of proteins, it shows that there is value to be had from this approach, and it opens the door to more in-depth characterizations at the ($\phi$,$\psi$)(2) level and at higher dimensions.},

abstract = {beta-Turns have been extracted from 59 non-identical proteins (resolution 2 A) using the standard criterion that the distance between C alpha (i) and C alpha (i + 3) is less than 7 A (1 A = 0.1 nm). The beta-turns have been classified, using phi, psi angles, into seven conventional turn types (I, I', II, II', IV, VIa, VIb) and a new class of beta-turn, designated type VIII, in which the central residues (i + 1, i + 2) adopt an alpha R beta conformation. Most beta-turn types are found in various topological environments, with the exception of I' and II' beta-turns, where 83{\%} and 50{\%}, respectively, are found in beta-hairpins. Sufficient data have been gathered to enable, for the first time, the separate statistical analysis of type I and II beta-turns. The two turn types have been shown to be strikingly different in their sequence preferences. Type I turns favour Asp, Asn, Ser and Cys at i; Asp, Ser, Thr and Pro at i + 1; Asp, Ser, Asn and Arg at i + 2; Gly, Trp and Met at i + 3, whilst type II turns prefer Pro at i + 1; Gly and Asn at i + 2; Gln and Arg at i + 3. These preferences have been explained by the specific side-chain interactions observed within the X-ray structures. The positional trends for type I and II beta-turns have been incorporated into the simple empirical predictive algorithm originally developed by P.N. Lewis et al. The program has improved the positional prediction of beta-turns, and has enhanced and extended the method by predicting the type of beta-turn. Since the observed preferences reflect local interactions these predictions are applicable not only to proteins, but also to peptides, many of which are thought to contain beta-turns.},

abstract = {Interresidue protein contacts in proteins structures and at protein-protein interface are classically described by the amino acid types of interacting residues and the local structural context of the contact, if any, is described using secondary structures. In this study, we present an alternate analysis of interresidue contact using local structures defined by the structural alphabet introduced by Camproux et al. This structural alphabet allows to describe a 3D structure as a sequence of prototype fragments called structural letters, of 27 different types. Each residue can then be assigned to a particular local structure, even in loop regions. The analysis of interresidue contacts within protein structures defined using Vorono{\"{i}} tessellations reveals that pairwise contact specificity is greater in terms of structural letters than amino acids. Using a simple heuristic based on specificity score comparison, we find that 74{\%} of the long-range contacts within protein structures are better described using structural letters than amino acid types. The investigation is extended to a set of protein-protein complexes, showing that the similar global rules apply as for intraprotein contacts, with 64{\%} of the interprotein contacts best described by local structures. We then present an evaluation of pairing functions integrating structural letters to decoy scoring and show that some complexes could benefit from the use of structural letter-based pairing functions.},

The analysis of unfolding trajectories at high temperatures suggests a refolding pathway consisting of several transient intermediates. The changes in the interaction energies of residues are related with the structural changes during the unfolding of the hairpin. The electrostatic energies of the residues in the turn region are found to be responsible for the transition between the folded state and the hydrophobic core state. The van der Waals interaction energies of the residues in the hydrophobic core reflect the behavior of the radius of gyration of the core region. We have examined the opposing influences of the protein-protein (PP) energy, which favors the native state, and the protein-solvent (PS) energy, which favors unfolding, in the formation of the beta-hairpin structure. It is found that the behavior of the electrostatic components of PP and PS energies reflects the structural changes associated with the loss of backbone hydrogen bonding. Relative changes in the PP and PS van der Waals interactions are related with the disruption of the hydrophobic core of a protein. The results of the simulations support the hydrophobic collapse mechanism of beta-hairpin folding.},

abstract = {Formation of beta-hairpins is considered the initial step of folding of many proteins and, consequently, peptides constituting the beta-hairpin sequence of proteins (the beta-hairpin-forming peptides) are considered as models of early stages of protein folding. In this article, we discuss the results of experimental studies (circular-dichroism, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry) of the structure of beta-hairpin-forming peptides excised from the B1 domain of protein G, which are known to fold on their own. We demonstrate that local interactions at the turn sequence and hydrophobic interactions between nonpolar residues are the dominant structure-determining factors, while there is no convincing evidence that stable backbone hydrogen bonds are formed in these peptides in aqueous solution. Consequently, the most plausible mechanism for folding of the beta-hairpin sequence appears to be the broken-zipper mechanism consisting of the following three steps: (i) bending the chain at the turn sequence owing to favorable local interactions, (ii) formation of loose hydrophobic contacts between nonpolar residues, which occur close to the contacts in the native structure of the protein but not exactly in the same position and, finally, (iii) formation of backbone hydrogen bonds and locking the hydrophobic contacts in the native positions as a hydrophobic core develops, sufficient to dehydrate the backbone peptide groups. This mechanism provides sufficient uniqueness (contacts form between residues that become close together because the chain is bent at the turn position) and robustness (contacts need not occur at once in the native positions) for folding a beta-hairpin sequence.},

We have studied the dependence of the unfolding pathway on pulling speed, cantilever stiffness, and attachment points. Under conditions that generate low forces, the unfolding trajectory mimics the untethered, thermally accessible pathway previously proposed based on high-temperature studies. In this stepwise pathway, complete breakdown of backbone hydrogen bonds precedes dissociation of the hydrophobic cluster. Under more extreme conditions, the cluster and hydrogen bonds break simultaneously. Transitions between folding intermediates can be identified in our simulations as features of the calculated force-extension curves.},

Knowing the timescales and mechanism of formation of these basic structural elements is essential for understanding how proteins fold. For the past 40 years, alpha-helix formation has been extensively investigated in synthetic and natural peptides, including by nanosecond kinetic studies. In contrast, the mechanism of formation of beta structures has not been studied experimentally. The minimal beta-structure element is the beta-hairpin, which is also the basic component of antiparallel beta-sheets. Here we use a nanosecond laser temperature-jump apparatus to study the kinetics of folding a beta-hairpin consisting of 16 amino-acid residues. Folding of the hairpin occurs in 6 micros at room temperature, which is about 30 times slower than the rate of alpha-helix formation. We have developed a simple statistical mechanical model that provides a structural explanation for this result. Our analysis also shows that folding of a beta-hairpin captures much of the basic physics of protein folding, including stabilization by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, two-state behaviour, and a funnel-like, partially rugged energy landscape.},

@article{Zhou2011,
abstract = {An accurate scoring function is a key component for successful protein structure prediction. To address this important unsolved problem, we develop a generalized orientation and distance-dependent all-atom statistical potential. The new statistical potential, generalized orientation-dependent all-atom potential (GOAP), depends on the relative orientation of the planes associated with each heavy atom in interacting pairs. GOAP is a generalization of previous orientation-dependent potentials that consider only representative atoms or blocks of side-chain or polar atoms. GOAP is decomposed into distance- and angle-dependent contributions. The DFIRE distance-scaled finite ideal gas reference state is employed for the distance-dependent component of GOAP. GOAP was tested on 11 commonly used decoy sets containing 278 targets, and recognized 226 native structures as best from the decoys, whereas DFIRE recognized 127 targets. The major improvement comes from decoy sets that have homology-modeled structures that are close to native (all within ∼4.0 {\AA}) or from the ROSETTA ab initio decoy set. For these two kinds of decoys, orientation-independent DFIRE or only side-chain orientation-dependent RWplus performed poorly. Although the OPUS-PSP block-based orientation-dependent, side-chain atom contact potential performs much better (recognizing 196 targets) than DFIRE, RWplus, and dDFIRE, it is still ∼15{\%} worse than GOAP. Thus, GOAP is a promising advance in knowledge-based, all-atom statistical potentials. GOAP is available for download at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/GOAP.},

@article{Rost1993,
abstract = {We have trained a two-layered feed-forward neural network on a non-redundant data base of 130 protein chains to predict the secondary structure of water-soluble proteins. A new key aspect is the use of evolutionary information in the form of multiple sequence alignments that are used as input in place of single sequences. The inclusion of protein family information in this form increases the prediction accuracy by six to eight percentage points. A combination of three levels of networks results in an overall three-state accuracy of 70.8{\%} for globular proteins (sustained performance). If four membrane protein chains are included in the evaluation, the overall accuracy drops to 70.2{\%}. The prediction is well balanced between alpha-helix, beta-strand and loop: 65{\%} of the observed strand residues are predicted correctly. The accuracy in predicting the content of three secondary structure types is comparable to that of circular dichroism spectroscopy. The performance accuracy is verified by a sevenfold cross-validation test, and an additional test on 26 recently solved proteins. Of particular practical importance is the definition of a position-specific reliability index. For half of the residues predicted with a high level of reliability the overall accuracy increases to better than 82{\%}. A further strength of the method is the more realistic prediction of segment length. The protein family prediction method is available for testing by academic researchers via an electronic mail server.},

@article{Bhattacharjee2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutation of amino acid sequences in a protein may have diverse effects on its structure and function. Point mutations of even a single amino acid residue in the helices of the non-redundant database may lead to sequentially identical peptides which adopt different secondary structures in different proteins. However, various physico-chemical factors which govern the formation of these ambivalent helices generated by point mutations of a sequence are not clearly known.

RESULTS: Sequences generated by point mutations of helices are mapped on to their non-helical counterparts in the SCOP database. The results show that short helices are prone to transform into non-helical conformations upon point mutations. Mutation of amino acid residues by helix breakers preferentially yield non-helical conformations, while mutation with residues of intermediate helix propensity display least preferences for non-helical conformations. Differences in the solvent accessibility of the mutating/mutated residues are found to be a major criteria for these sequences to conform to non-helical conformations. Even with minimal differences in the amino acid distributions of the sequences flanking the helical and non-helical conformations, helix-flanking sequences are found be more solvent accessible.

CONCLUSIONS: All types of mutations from helical to non-helical conformations are investigated. The primary factors attributing such changes in conformation can be: i) type/propensity of the mutating and mutant residues ii) solvent accessibility of the residue at the mutation site iii) context/environment dependence of the flanking sequences. The results from the present study may be used to design de novo proteins via point mutations.},

We provide a brief review of the six most frequent research problems tackled with Rosetta. For each of these six tasks, we provide a tutorial that illustrates a basic Rosetta protocol. The Rosetta method was originally developed for de novo protein structure prediction and is regularly one of the best performers in the community-wide biennial Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction. Predictions for protein domains with fewer than 125 amino acids regularly have a backbone root-mean-square deviation of better than 5.0 A. More impressively, there are several cases in which Rosetta has been used to predict structures with atomic level accuracy better than 2.5 A. In addition to de novo structure prediction, Rosetta also has methods for molecular docking, homology modeling, determining protein structures from sparse experimental NMR or EPR data, and protein design. Rosetta has been used to accurately design a novel protein structure, predict the structure of protein-protein complexes, design altered specificity protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and stabilize proteins and protein complexes. Most recently, Rosetta has been used to solve the X-ray crystallographic phase problem.},

@article{Kim2009,
abstract = {The primary obstacle to de novo protein structure prediction is conformational sampling: the native state generally has lower free energy than nonnative structures but is exceedingly difficult to locate. Structure predictions with atomic level accuracy have been made for small proteins using the Rosetta structure prediction method, but for larger and more complex proteins, the native state is virtually never sampled, and it has been unclear how much of an increase in computing power would be required to successfully predict the structures of such proteins. In this paper, we develop an approach to determining how much computer power is required to accurately predict the structure of a protein, based on a reformulation of the conformational search problem as a combinatorial sampling problem in a discrete feature space. We find that conformational sampling for many proteins is limited by critical "linchpin" features, often the backbone torsion angles of individual residues, which are sampled very rarely in unbiased trajectories and, when constrained, dramatically increase the sampling of the native state. These critical features frequently occur in less regular and likely strained regions of proteins that contribute to protein function. In a number of proteins, the linchpin features are in regions found experimentally to form late in folding, suggesting a correspondence between folding in silico and in reality.},

For more than 50 years, they have been predicted at a low-resolution coarse-grained level (e.g., three-state secondary structure). Here, we combine a two-state classifier with real-value predictor to predict local structure in continuous representation by backbone torsion angles. The accuracy of the angles predicted by this approach is close to that derived from NMR chemical shifts. Their substitution for predicted secondary structure as restraints for ab initio structure prediction doubles the success rate. This result demonstrates the potential of predicted local structure for fragment-free tertiary-structure prediction. It further implies potentially significant benefits from using predicted real-valued torsion angles as a replacement for or supplement to the secondary-structure prediction tools used almost exclusively in many computational methods ranging from sequence alignment to function prediction.},

abstract = {Protein structure prediction is one of the major challenges in bioinformatics today. Throughout the past five decades, many different algorithmic approaches have been attempted, and although progress has been made the problem remains unsolvable even for many small proteins. While the general objective is to predict the three-dimensional structure from primary sequence, our current knowledge and computational power are simply insufficient to solve a problem of such high complexity. Some prediction algorithms do, however, appear to perform better than others, although it is not always obvious which ones they are and it is perhaps even less obvious why that is. In this review, the reported performance results from 18 different recently published prediction algorithms are compared. Furthermore, the general algorithmic settings most likely responsible for the difference in the reported performance are identified, and the specific settings of each of the 18 prediction algorithms are also compared. The average normalized r.m.s.d. scores reported range from 11.17 to 3.48. With a performance measure including both r.m.s.d. scores and CPU time, the currently best-performing prediction algorithm is identified to be the I-TASSER algorithm. Two of the algorithmic settings--protein representation and fragment assembly--were found to have definite positive influence on the running time and the predicted structures, respectively. There thus appears to be a clear benefit from incorporating this knowledge in the design of new prediction algorithms.},

Using the Enzyme Commission and the Gene Ontology classifications as a reference frame, and integrating structure data from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), target sequences from the structural genomics projects, structure homology derived from the SUPERFAMILY database, and genome annotations from Ensembl and NCBI, we provide a quantified view, both at the domain and whole-protein levels, of the current and projected coverage of protein structure and function space relative to the human genome. Protein structures currently provide at least one domain that covers 37{\%} of the functional classes identified in the genome; whole structure coverage exists for 25{\%} of the genome. If all the structural genomics targets were solved (twice the current number of structures in the PDB), it is estimated that structures of one domain would cover 69{\%} of the functional classes identified and complete structure coverage would be 44{\%}. Homology models from existing experimental structures extend the 37{\%} coverage to 56{\%} of the genome as single domains and 25{\%} to 31{\%} for complete structures. Coverage from homology models is not evenly distributed by protein family, reflecting differing degrees of sequence and structure divergence within families. While these data provide coverage, conversely, they also systematically highlight functional classes of proteins for which structures should be determined.

Understanding the emergence of novel protein folds is an important step towards understanding the rules governing the evolution of protein structure and function and for developing tools for protein structure modeling and design. We explored the frequency of occurrences of an exhaustively classified library of supersecondary structural elements (Smotifs), in protein structures, in order to identify features that would define a fold as novel compared to previously known structures. We found that a surprisingly small set of Smotifs is sufficient to describe all known folds. Furthermore, novel folds do not require novel Smotifs, but rather are a new combination of existing ones. Novel folds can be typified by the inclusion of a relatively higher number of rarely occurring Smotifs in their structures and, to a lesser extent, by a novel topological combination of commonly occurring Smotifs. When investigating the structural features of Smotifs, we found that the top 10{\%} of most frequent ones have a higher fraction of internal contacts, while some of the most rare motifs are larger, and contain a longer loop region.},

@article{Olivella2002,
abstract = {The influence of the solvent on the main-chain conformation (phi and Psi dihedral angles) of alpha-helices has been studied by complementary approaches. A first approach consisted in surveying crystal structures of both soluble and membrane proteins. The residues of analysis were further classified as exposed to either the water (polar solvent) or the lipid (apolar solvent) environment or buried to the core of the protein (intermediate polarity). The statistical results show that the more polar the environment, the lower the value of phi(i) and the higher the value of Psi(i) are. The intrahelical hydrogen bond distance increases in water-exposed residues due to the additional hydrogen bond between the peptide carbonyl oxygen and the aqueous environment. A second approach involved nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations of poly-Ala alpha-helices in environments of different polarity: water to mimic hydrophilic environments that can form hydrogen bonds with the peptide carbonyl oxygen and methane to mimic hydrophobic environments without this hydrogen bond capabilities. These simulations reproduce similar effects in phi and Psi angles and intrahelical hydrogen bond distance and angle as observed in the protein survey analysis. The magnitude of the intrahelical hydrogen bond in the methane environment is stronger than in the water environment, suggesting that alpha-helices in membrane-embedded proteins are less flexible than in soluble proteins. There is a remarkable coincidence between the phi and Psi angles obtained in the analysis of residues exposed to the lipid in membrane proteins and the results from computer simulations in methane, which suggests that this simulation protocol properly mimic the lipidic cell membrane and reproduce several structural characteristics of membrane-embedded proteins. Finally, we have compared the phi and Psi torsional angles of Pro kinks in membrane protein crystal structures and in computer simulations.},

abstract = {Understanding the sequence-structure relationships in globular proteins is important for reliable protein structure prediction and de novo design. Using a database of 1131 alpha-helices with nonidentical sequences from 205 nonhomologous globular protein chains, we have analyzed structural and sequence characteristics of alpha-helices. We find that geometries of more than 99{\%} of all the alpha-helices can be simply characterised as being linear, curved, or kinked. Only a small number of alpha-helices ( approximately 4{\%}) show sharp localized bends in their middle regions, and thus are classified as kinked. Approximately three-fourths (approximately 73{\%}) of the alpha-helices in globular proteins show varying degrees of smooth curvature, with a mean radius of curvature of 65 +/- 33 A; longer helices are less curved. Computation of helix accessibility to the solvent indicates that nearly two-thirds of the helices ( approximately 66{\%}) are largely buried in the protein core, and the length and geometry of the helices are not correlated with their location in the protein globule. However, the amino acid compositions and propensities of individual amino acids to occur in alpha-helices vary with their location in the protein globule, their geometries, and their lengths. In particular, Gln, Glu, Lys, and Arg are found more often in helices near the surface of globular proteins. Interestingly, kinks often seem to occur in regions where amino acids with low helix propensities (e.g., beta-branched and aromatic residues) cluster together, in addition to those associated with the occurrence of proline residues. Hence the propensities of individual amino acids to occur in a given secondary structure depend not only on conformation but also on its length, geometry, and location in the protein globule.},

abstract = {Accurate assignments of secondary structures in proteins are crucial for a useful comparison with theoretical predictions. Three major programs which automatically determine the location of helices and strands are used for this purpose, namely DSSP, P-Curve and Define. Their results have been compared for a non-redundant database of 154 proteins. On a residue per residue basis, the percentage match score is only 63{\%} between the three methods. While these methods agree on the overall number of residues in each of the three states (helix, strand or coil), they differ on the number of helices or strands, thus implying a wide discrepancy in the length of assigned structural elements. Moreover, the length distribution of helices and strands points to the existence of artefacts inherent to each assignment algorithm. To overcome these difficulties a consensus assignment is proposed where each residue is assigned to the state determined by at least two of the three methods. With this assignment the artefacts of each algorithm are attenuated. The residues assigned in the same state by the three methods are better predicted than the others. This assignment will thus be useful for analysing the success rate of prediction methods more accurately.},

abstract = {How to make an objective assignment of secondary structures based on a protein structure is an unsolved problem. Defining the boundaries between helix, sheet, and coil structures is arbitrary, and commonly accepted standard assignments do not exist. Here, we propose a criterion that assesses secondary structure assignment based on the similarity of the secondary structures assigned to pairwise sequence-alignment benchmarks, where these benchmarks are determined by prior structural alignments of the protein pairs. This criterion is used to rank six secondary structure assignment methods: STRIDE, DSSP, SECSTR, KAKSI, P-SEA, and SEGNO with three established sequence-alignment benchmarks (PREFAB, SABmark, and SALIGN). STRIDE and KAKSI achieve comparable success rates in assigning the same secondary structure elements to structurally aligned residues in the three benchmarks. Their success rates are between 1-4{\%} higher than those of the other four methods. The consensus of STRIDE, KAKSI, SECSTR, and P-SEA, called SKSP, improves assignments over the best single method in each benchmark by an additional 1{\%}. These results support the usefulness of the sequence-alignment benchmarks as a means to evaluate secondary structure assignment. The SKSP server and the benchmarks can be accessed at http://sparks.informatics.iupui.edu},

@article{Richards1988,
abstract = {A computer program is described that produces a description of the secondary structure and supersecondary structure of a polypeptide chain using the list of alpha carbon coordinates as input. Restricting the term "secondary structure" to the conformation of contiguous segments of the chain, the program determines the initial and final residues in helices, extended strands, sharp turns, and omega loops. This is accomplished through the use of difference distance matrices. The distances in idealized models of the segments are compared with the actual structure, and the differences are evaluated for agreement within preset limits. The program assigns 90-95{\%} of the residues in most proteins to at least one type of secondary element. In a second step the now-defined helices and strands are idealized as straight line segments, and the axial directions and locations are compiled from the input C alpha coordinate list. These data are used to check for moderate curvature in strands and helices, and the secondary structure list is corrected where necessary. The geometric relations between these line segments are then calculated and output as the first level of supersecondary structure. A maximum of six parameters are required for a complete description of the relations between each pair. Frequently a less complete description will suffice, for example just the interaxial separation and angle. Both the secondary structure and one aspect of the supersecondary structure can be displayed in a character matrix analogous to the distance matrix format. This allows a quite accurate two-dimensional display of the three-dimensional structure, and several examples are presented. A procedure for searching for arbitrary substructures in proteins using distance matrices is also described. A search for the DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif in the Protein Data Bank serves as an example. A further abstraction of the above data can be made in the form of a metamatrix where each diagonal element represents an entire secondary segment rather than a single atom, and the off-diagonal elements contain all the parameters describing their interrelations. Such matrices can be used in a straightforward search for higher levels of supersecondary structure or used in toto as a representation of the entire tertiary structure of the polypeptide chain.},

abstract = {Here, we depict the anatomy of protein structures in terms of the protein folding process. Via an iterative, top-down dissecting procedure, tertiary structures are spliced down to reveal their anatomy: first, to produce domains (defined by visual three-dimensional inspection criteria); then, hydrophobic folding units (HFU); and, at the end of a multilevel process, a set of building blocks. The resulting anatomy tree organization not only clearly depicts the organization of a one-dimensional polypeptide chain in three-dimensional space but also straightforwardly describes the most likely folding pathway(s). Comparison of the tree with the formation of the hydrophobic folding units through combinatorial assembly of the building blocks illustrates how the chain folds in a sequential or a complex folding pathway. Further, the tree points to the kinetics of the folding, whether the chain is a fast or a slow folder, and the probability of misfolding. Our ability to successfully dissect the protein into an anatomy tree illustrates that protein folding is a hierarchical process and further validates a building blocks protein folding model.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The precise prediction of one-dimensional (1D) protein structure as represented by the protein secondary structure and 1D string of discrete state of dihedral angles (i.e. Shape Strings) is a prerequisite for the successful prediction of three-dimensional (3D) structure as well as protein-protein interaction. We have developed a novel 1D structure prediction method, called Frag1D, based on a straightforward fragment matching algorithm and demonstrated its success in the prediction of three sets of 1D structural alphabets, i.e. the classical three-state secondary structure, three- and eight-state Shape Strings.

RESULTS: By exploiting the vast protein sequence and protein structure data available, we have brought secondary-structure prediction closer to the expected theoretical limit. When tested by a leave-one-out cross validation on a non-redundant set of PDB cutting at 30{\%} sequence identity containing 5860 protein chains, the overall per-residue accuracy for secondary-structure prediction, i.e. Q3 is 82.9{\%}. The overall per-residue accuracy for three- and eight-state Shape Strings are 85.1 and 71.5{\%}, respectively. We have also benchmarked our program with the latest version of PSIPRED for secondary structure prediction and our program predicted 0.3{\%} better in Q3 when tested on 2241 chains with the same training set. For Shape Strings, we compared our method with a recently published method with the same dataset and definition as used by that method. Our program predicted at 2.2{\%} better in accuracy for three-state Shape Strings. By quantitatively investigating the effect of data base size on 1D structure prediction we show that the accuracy increases by approximately 1{\%} with every doubling of the database size.},

abstract = {Many single-domain proteins exhibit two-state folding kinetics, with folding rates that span more than six orders of magnitude. A quantity of much recent interest for such proteins is their contact order, the average separation in sequence between contacting residue pairs. Numerous studies have reached the surprising conclusion that contact order is well-correlated with the logarithm of the folding rate for these small, well-characterized molecules. Here, we investigate the physico-chemical basis for this finding by asking whether contact order is actually a composite number that measures the fraction of local secondary structure in the protein; viz. turns, helices, and hairpins. To pursue this question, we calculated the secondary structure content for 24 two-state proteins and obtained coefficients that predict their folding rates. The predicted rates correlate strongly with experimentally determined rates, comparable to the correlation with contact order. Further, these predicted folding rates are correlated strongly with contact order. Our results suggest that the folding rate of two-state proteins is a function of their local secondary structure content, consistent with the hierarchic model of protein folding. Accordingly, it should be possible to utilize secondary structure prediction methods to predict folding rates from sequence alone.},

abstract = {Elucidation of the detailed structural features and sequence requirements for alpha helices of various lengths could be very important in understanding secondary structure formation in proteins and, hence, in the protein folding mechanism. An algorithm to characterize the geometry of an alpha helix from its C(alpha) coordinates has been developed and used to analyze the structures of long alpha helices (number of residues {\textgreater} or = 25) found in globular proteins, the crystal structure coordinates of which are available from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. All long alpha helices can be unambiguously characterized as belonging to one of three classes: linear, curved, or kinked, with a majority being curved. Analysis of the sequences of these helices reveals that the long alpha helices have unique sequence characteristics that distinguish them from the short alpha helices in globular proteins. The distribution and statistical propensities of individual amino acids to occur in long alpha helices are different from those found in short alpha helices, with amino acids having longer side chains and/or having a greater number of functional groups occurring more frequently in these helices. The sequences of the long alpha helices can be correlated with their gross structural features, i.e., whether they are curved, linear, or kinked, and in case of the curved helices, with their curvature.},

abstract = {In this report we describe a general survey of all helices found in 57 of the known protein crystal structures, together with a detailed analysis of 48 $\alpha$-helices found in 16 of the structures that are determined to high resolution. The survey of all helices reveals a total of 291 $\alpha$-helices, 71 310-helices and no examples of $\pi$-helices. The conformations of the observed helices are significantly different from the “ideal” linear structures. The mean $\phi$, $\psi$ angles for the $\alpha$- and 310-helices found in proteins are, respectively, (−62 °, −41 °) and (−71 °, −18 °). A computer program, HBEND, is used to characterize and to quantify the different types of helix distortion. $\alpha$-Helices are classified as regular or irregular, linear, curved or kinked. Of the 48 $\alpha$-helices analysed, only 15{\%} are considered to be linear; 17{\%} are kinked, and 58{\%} are curved. The curvature of helices is caused by differences in the peptide hydrogen bonding on opposite faces of the helix, reflecting carbonyl-solvent/side-chain interactions for the exposed residues, and packing constraints for residues involved in the hydrophobic core. Kinked helices arise either as a result of included proline residues, or because of conflicting requirements for the optimal packing of the helix side-chains. In $\alpha$-helices where there are kinks caused by proline residues, we show that the angle of kink is relatively constant ({\~{}}26 °), and that there is minimal disruption of the helix hydrogen bonding. The proline residues responsible for the kinks are highly conserved, suggesting that these distortions may be structurally/functionally important.},

@article{Manikandan2004,
abstract = {A comprehensive database analysis of C--H...O hydrogen bonds in 3124 alpha-helices and their corresponding helix termini has been carried out from a nonredundant data set of high-resolution globular protein structures resolved at better than 2.0 A in order to investigate their role in the helix, the important protein secondary structural element. The possible occurrence of 5 --{\textgreater} 1 C--H...O hydrogen bond between the ith residue CH group and (i - 4)th residue C==O with C...O {\textless} or = 3.8 A is studied, considering as potential donors the main-chain Calpha and the side-chain carbon atoms Cbeta, Cgamma, Cdelta and Cepsilon. Similar analysis has been carried out for 4 --{\textgreater} 1 C--H...O hydrogen bonds, since the C--H...O hydrogen bonds found in helices are predominantly of type 5 --{\textgreater} 1 or 4 --{\textgreater} 1. A total of 17,367 (9310 of type 5 --{\textgreater} 1 and 8057 of type 4 --{\textgreater} 1) C--H...O hydrogen bonds are found to satisfy the selected criteria. The average stereochemical parameters for the data set suggest that the observed C--H...O hydrogen bonds are attractive interactions. Our analysis reveals that the Cgamma and Cbeta hydrogen atom(s) are frequently involved in such hydrogen bonds. A marked preference is noticed for aliphatic beta-branched residue Ile to participate in 5 --{\textgreater} 1 C--H...O hydrogen bonds involving methylene Cgamma 1 atom as donor in alpha-helices. This may be an enthalpic compensation for the greater loss of side-chain conformational entropy for beta-branched amino acids due to the constraint on side-chain torsion angle, namely, chi1, when they occur in helices. The preference of amino acids for 4 --{\textgreater} 1 C--H...O hydrogen bonds is found to be more for Asp, Cys, and for aromatic residues Trp, Phe, and His. Interestingly, overall propensity for C--H...O hydrogen bonds shows that a majority of the helix favoring residues such as Met, Glu, Arg, Lys, Leu, and Gln, which also have large side-chains, prefer to be involved in such types of weak attractive interactions in helices. The amino acid side-chains that participate in C--H...O interactions are found to shield the acceptor carbonyl oxygen atom from the solvent. In addition, C--H...O hydrogen bonds are present along with helix stabilizing salt bridges. A novel helix terminating interaction motif, X-Gly with Gly at C(cap) position having 5 --{\textgreater} 1 Calpha--H...O, and a chain reversal structural motif having 1 --{\textgreater} 5 Calpha-H...O have been identified and discussed. Our analysis highlights that a multitude of local C--H...O hydrogen bonds formed by a variety of amino acid side-chains and Calpha hydrogen atoms occur in helices and more so at the helix termini. It may be surmised that the main-chain Calpha and the side-chain CH that participate in C--H...O hydrogen bonds collectively augment the cohesive energy and thereby contribute together with the classical N--H...O hydrogen bonds and other interactions to the overall stability of helix and therefore of proteins.},

abstract = {An analysis of the amino acid distributions at 15 positions, viz., N", N', Ncap, N1, N2, N3, N4, Mid, C4, C3, C2, C1, Ccap, C', and C" in 1,131 alpha-helices reveals that each position has its own unique characteristics. In general, natural helix sequences optimize by identifying the residues to be avoided at a given position and minimizing the occurrence of these avoided residues rather than by maximizing the preferred residues at various positions. Ncap is most selective in its choice of residues, with six amino acids (S, D, T, N, G, and P) being preferred at this position and another 11 (V, I, F, A, K, L, Y, R, E, M, and Q) being strongly avoided. Ser, Asp, and Thr are all more preferred at Ncap position than Asn, whose role at helix N-terminus has been highlighted by earlier analyses. Furthermore, Asn is also found to be almost equally preferred at helix C-terminus and a novel structural motif is identified, involving a hydrogen bond formed by N delta 2 of Asn at Ccap or C1 position, with the backbone carbonyl oxygen four residues inside the helix. His also forms a similar motif at the C-terminus. Pro is the most avoided residue in the main body (N4 to C4 positions) and at C-terminus, including Ccap of an alpha-helix. In 1,131 alpha-helices, no helix contains Pro at C3 or C2 positions. However, Pro is highly favoured at N1 and C'. The doublet X-Pro, with Pro at C' position and extended backbone conformation for the X residue at Ccap, appears to be a common structural motif for termination of alpha-helices, in addition to the Schellman motif. Main body of the helix shows a high preference for aliphatic residues Ala, Leu, Val, and Ile, while these are avoided at helix termini. A propensity scale for amino acids to occur in the middle of helices has been obtained. Comparison of this scale with several previously reported scales shows that this scale correlates best with the experimentally determined values.},

The results confirm earlier observations, such as asymmetrical charge distributions in the first and last helical turn, but several new, sharp preferences are found as well. The most striking of these are a 3.5:1 preference for Asn at the N-cap position, and a preference of 2.6:1 for Pro at N-cap + 1. The C-cap position is overwhelmingly dominated by Gly, which ends 34 percent of the helices. Hydrophobic residues peak at positions N-cap + 4 and C-cap - 4.},

@article{Wilmot1990,
abstract = {Using the new version of a Protein Structural Database, BIPED, beta-turns have been extracted from 58 non-identical proteins (resolution less than or equal to 2 A) using the standard criteria that the distance between C alpha i and C alpha i + 3 is less than 7 A and that the central residues are not helical. It has been shown that 42{\%} of these do not fit into the eight conventional turn types (I, I', II, II', VIa, VIb and VIII) as defined by phi, psi limits for residues i + 1 and i + 2. Most of the unclassified turns are 'distortions' of the standard turn types, lying just outside the specified limits. Eleven per cent of the turns are not related to the standard types, and have completely different phi, psi combinations. Therefore, the conformational space available to a trans tetrapeptide has been explored to find all two-residue phi, psi combinations which satisfy the criteria for beta-turn formation. The conformations generated by the search are the conformations observed in the data. On the basis of these observations a new nomenclature is suggested for beta-turns based on a shorthand descriptor of populated regions of the phi, psi plot. For example, it is proposed that a type I turn should now be described as an alpha alpha turn, the descriptor indicating the phi, psi regions of the i + 1 and i + 2 positions of the turn. The use of descriptors, which convey information about the turn type conformation, should aid protein structural workers in turn classification and visualization. The sequence preferences for the alpha beta turn have been elucidated: Pro, Asp and Ser at i + 1; Asn and His at i + 2; Pro at i + 3. These preferences have been explained in terms of specific interactions involving the side-chains. The beta-turn prediction program, BTURN 1.0, has been further developed by alterations to the calculation of parameters, the removal of incompatible multiple turn predictions and the inclusion of the distorted types alpha alpha and beta p gamma data in the respective sets of parameters, to yield BTURN 2.0. A variation of this beta-turn prediction program, called GORBTURN 1.0, has been developed, which uses the directional parameters produced from work by Garrett et al., to eliminate potential helix and strand-forming residues from the beta-turn prediction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {This review attempts a critical stock-taking of the current state of the science aimed at predicting structural features of proteins from their amino acid sequences. At the primary structure level, methods are considered for detection of remotely related sequences and for recognizing amino acid patterns to predict posttranslational modifications and binding sites. The techniques involving secondary structural features include prediction of secondary structure, membrane-spanning regions, and secondary structural class. At the tertiary structural level, methods for threading a sequence into a mainchain fold, homology modeling and assigning sequences to protein families with similar folds are discussed. A literature analysis suggests that, to date, threading techniques are not able to show their superiority over sequence pattern recognition methods. Recent progress in the state of ab initio structure calculation is reviewed in detail. The analysis shows that many structural features can be predicted from the amino acid sequence much better than just a few years ago and with attendant utility in experimental research. Best prediction can be achieved for new protein sequences that can be assigned to well-studied protein families. For single sequences without homologues, the folding problem has not yet been solved.},

abstract = {Efficient and accurate reconstruction of secondary structure elements in the context of protein structure prediction is the major focus of this work. We present a novel approach capable of reconstructing alpha-helices and beta-sheets in atomic detail. The method is based on Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations in a force field of empirical potentials that are designed to stabilize secondary structure elements in room-temperature simulations. Particular attention is paid to lateral side-chain interactions in beta-sheets and between the turns of alpha-helices, as well as backbone hydrogen bonding. The force constants are optimized using contrastive divergence, a novel machine learning technique, from a data set of known structures. Using this approach, we demonstrate the applicability of the framework to the problem of reconstructing the overall protein fold for a number of commonly studied small proteins, based on only predicted secondary structure and contact map. For protein G and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2, we are able to reconstruct the secondary structure elements in atomic detail and the overall protein folds with a root mean-square deviation of {\textless}10 A. For cold-shock protein and the SH3 domain, we accurately reproduce the secondary structure elements and the topology of the 5-stranded beta-sheets, but not the barrel structure. The importance of high-quality secondary structure and contact map prediction is discussed.},

@article{Betancourt2004,
abstract = {The following three issues concerning the backbone dihedral angles of protein structures are presented. (1) How do the dihedral angles of the 20 amino acids depend on the identity and conformation of their nearest residues? (2) To what extent are the native dihedral angles determined by local (dihedral) potentials? (3) How to build a knowledge-based potential for a residue's dihedral angles, considering the identity and conformation of its nearest residues? We find that the dihedral angle distribution for a residue can significantly depend on the identity and conformation of its adjacent residues. These correlations are in sharp contrast to the Flory isolated-pair hypothesis. Statistical potentials are built for all combinations of residue triplets and depend on the dihedral angles between consecutive residues. First, a low-resolution potential is obtained, which only differentiates between the main populated basins in the dihedral angle density plots. Minimization of the dihedral potential for 125 test proteins reveals that most native alpha-helical residues (89{\%}) and a large fraction of native beta-sheet residues (47{\%}) adopt conformations close to their native one. For native loop residues, the percentage is 48{\%}. It is also found that this fraction is higher for residues away from the ends of alpha or beta secondary structure elements. In addition, a higher resolution potential is built as a function of dihedral angles by a smoothing procedure and continuous functions interpolations. Monte Carlo energy minimization with this potential results in a lower fraction for native beta-sheet residues. Nevertheless, because of the higher flexibility and entropy of beta structures, they could be preferred under the influence of non-local interactions. In general, most alpha-helices and many beta-sheets are strongly determined by the local potential, while the conformations in loops and near the end of beta-sheets are more influenced by non-local interactions.},

abstract = {Protein structural information can be uncovered using an information-theory-based entropy and auxiliary functions by taking advantage of high-quality correlation plots between the dihedral angles around a residue and those between sequential residues. A standard information entropy for a primary sequence has been defined using the values of the probabilities of the most likely dihedral angles along the sequence. The distribution of entropy differences relative to the standard for each protein in a reference set--a sublibrary of the Protein Data Bank at the 90{\%} sequence redundancy level--appears to be nearly Gaussian. It gives rise to an auxiliary checking function whose value signals the extent to which the dihedral angle propensities differ from typical structures. Such deviations can arise either because of incorrect dihedral angle assignments or secondary structural propensities that are atypical of the structures in the reference set. This auxiliary checking function can be readily calculated at the public website, (http://www.d2check.gatech.edu). Its utility is demonstrated here in an analysis displaying differences between experimentally and theoretically derived structures, and in the analysis of structures derived by homology modeling. A comparison of the new measure, D(2)Check, to other checking functions based on backbone conformation-namely, PROCHECK and WHAT{\_}CHECK--is also provided.},

These $\beta$-breaker residues are at the origin of the kink between the $\beta$-strand and the turn that precedes or follows it. $\beta$-Breakers can be located automatically using a consensus approach based on algorithmic secondary structure assignment, solvent accessibility and backbone dihedral angles. These $\beta$-breakers are conformationally homogeneous with respect to side-chain solvent accessibility and backbone dihedral angle profile. A sequence-structure correlation is noted: a restricted subset of amino acids is observed at these positions. Analysis of homologous protein sequences shows that these residues are more highly conserved than other residues in the loop. We conclude that $\beta$-breakers are the structural analogs of the N and C-terminal caps of $\alpha$-helices. The identification of this aperiodic substructure suggests a strategy for improving secondary structure prediction and may guide site-directed mutagenesis experiments.},

The query sequence is scanned for segments 7 to 19 residues in length that strongly match one of the 82 patterns in the library. Matching segments are assigned the three-dimensional structure characteristic of the corresponding sequence pattern, and backbone torsion angles for the entire query sequence are then predicted by piecing together mutually compatible segment predictions. In predictions of local structure in a test set of 55 proteins, about 50{\%} of all residues, and 76{\%} of residues covered by high-confidence predictions, were found in eight-residue segments within 1.4 A of their true structures.

Here, we show that spectroscopic studies of a complete library of 400 dipeptides reveal that, irrespective of side-chain properties, the backbone conformation distribution is narrow and they adopt polyproline II and $\beta$-strand, indicating the importance of backbone peptide solvation and electronic effects. By directly comparing the dipeptide circular dichroism and NMR results with those of unfolded proteins, the comprehensive dipeptides form a complete set of structural motifs of unfolded proteins. We thus anticipate that the present dipeptide library with spectroscopic data can serve as a useful database for understanding the nature of unfolded protein structures and for further refinements of molecular mechanical parameters.},

abstract = {Unfolded peptides in water have some residual structure that may be important in the folding process, and the nature of the residual structure is currently of much interest. There is a neighboring residue effect on backbone conformation, discovered in 1997 from measurements of (3)J(HN alpha) coupling constants. The neighboring residue effect appears also in the "coil library" of Protein Data Bank structures of residues not in alpha-helix and not in beta-structure. When a neighboring residue (i - 1 or i + 1) belongs to class L (aromatic and beta-branched amino acids, FHITVWY) rather than class S (all others, G and P excluded), then the backbone angle of residue i is more negative for essentially all amino acids. Calculated values of peptide solvation (electrostatic solvation free energy, ESF) predict basic properties of the neighboring residue effect. We show that L amino acids reduce the solvation of neighboring peptide groups more than S amino acids. When tripeptides from the coil library are excised to allow solvation, the central residues have more negative values of {\textless}phi{\textgreater} but less negative values of {\textless}ESF{\textgreater} with L than with S neighbors. The coil library values of {\textless}(3)J(HN alpha){\textgreater}, which vary strikingly among the amino acids, are correlated with the neighboring residue effect seen by ESF. Moreover, values for the "blocking effect" of side chains on the hydrogen exchange rates of peptide NH protons are correlated with ESF values.},

abstract = {The preferences of amino acid residues for ,psi backbone angles vary strikingly among the amino acids, as shown by the backbone angle found from the (3)J(H(alpha),H(N)) coupling constant for short peptides in water. New data for the (3)J(H(alpha),H(N)) values of blocked amino acids (dipeptides) are given here. Dipeptides exhibit the full range of coupling constants shown by longer peptides such as GGXGG and dipeptides present the simplest system for analyzing backbone preferences. The dipeptide coupling constants are surprisingly close to values computed from the coil library (conformations of residues not in helices and not in sheets). Published coupling constants for GGXGG peptides agree closely with dipeptide values for all nonpolar residues and for some polar residues but not for X = D, N, T, and Y, which are probably affected by polar side chain-backbone interactions in GGXGG peptides. Thus, intrinsic backbone preferences are already determined at the dipeptide level and remain almost unchanged in GGXGG peptides and are strikingly similar in the coil library of conformations from protein structures. The simplest explanation for the backbone preferences is that backbone conformations are strongly affected by electrostatic dipole-dipole interactions in the peptide backbone and by screening of these interactions with water, which depends on nearby side chains. Strong backbone electrostatic interactions occur in dipeptides. This is shown by calculations both of backbone electrostatic energy for different conformers of the alanine dipeptide in the gas phase and by electrostatic solvation free energies of amino acid dipeptides.},

abstract = {The amino acid sequences of proteins determine their three-dimensional structures and functions. However, how sequence information is related to structures and functions is still enigmatic. In this study, we show that at least a part of the sequence information can be extracted by treating amino acid sequences of proteins as a collection of English words, based on a working hypothesis that amino acid sequences of proteins are composed of short constituent amino acid sequences (SCSs) or "words". We first confirmed that the English language highly likely follows Zipf's law, a special case of power law. We found that the rank-frequency plot of SCSs in proteins exhibits a similar distribution when low-rank tails are excluded. In comparison with natural English and "compressed" English without spaces between words, amino acid sequences of proteins show larger linear ranges and smaller exponents with heavier low-rank tails, demonstrating that the SCS distribution in proteins is largely scale-free. A distribution pattern of SCSs in proteins is similar among species, but species-specific features are also present. Based on the availability scores of SCSs, we found that sequence motifs are enriched in high-availability sites (i.e., "key words") and vice versa. In fact, the highest availability peak within a given protein sequence often directly corresponds to a sequence motif. The amino acid composition of high-availability sites within motifs is different from that of entire motifs and all protein sequences, suggesting the possible functional importance of specific SCSs and their compositional amino acids within motifs. We anticipate that our availability-based word decoding approach is complementary to sequence alignment approaches in predicting functionally important sites of unknown proteins from their amino acid sequences.},

abstract = {We developed a composite machine-learning based algorithm, called ANGLOR, to predict real-value protein backbone torsion angles from amino acid sequences. The input features of ANGLOR include sequence profiles, predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility. In a large-scale benchmarking test, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the phi/psi prediction is 28 degrees/46 degrees , which is approximately 10{\%} lower than that generated by software in literature. The prediction is statistically different from a random predictor (or a purely secondary-structure-based predictor) with p-value {\textless}1.0 x 10(-300) (or {\textless}1.0 x 10(-148)) by Wilcoxon signed rank test. For some residues (ILE, LEU, PRO and VAL) and especially the residues in helix and buried regions, the MAE of phi angles is much smaller (10-20 degrees ) than that in other environments. Thus, although the average accuracy of the ANGLOR prediction is still low, the portion of the accurately predicted dihedral angles may be useful in assisting protein fold recognition and ab initio 3D structure modeling.},

abstract = {Peptides often have conformational preferences. We simulated 133 peptide 8-mer fragments from six different proteins, sampled by replica-exchange molecular dynamics using Amber7 with a GB/SA (generalized-Born/solvent-accessible electrostatic approximation to water) implicit solvent. We found that 85 of the peptides have no preferred structure, while 48 of them converge to a preferred structure. In 85{\%} of the converged cases (41 peptides), the structures found by the simulations bear some resemblance to their native structures, based on a coarse-grained backbone description. In particular, all seven of the beta hairpins in the native structures contain a fragment in the turn that is highly structured. In the eight cases where the bioinformatics-based I-sites library picks out native-like structures, the present simulations are largely in agreement. Such physics-based modeling may be useful for identifying early nuclei in folding kinetics and for assisting in protein-structure prediction methods that utilize the assembly of peptide fragments.},

Atomistic molecular simulations with explicit solvent are the most promising method for providing this information, by accounting more directly for the physical interactions that stabilize proteins. Although simulations of folding with such force fields are extremely challenging, they have become feasible as a result of recent advances in computational power, accuracy of the energy functions or 'force fields', and methods for improving sampling of folding events. I review the recent progress in these areas, and highlight future challenges and questions that we may hope to address with these methods.

abstract = {Formation of $\alpha$-helices is a fundamental process in protein folding and assembly. By studying helix formation in molecular simulations of a series of alanine-based peptides, we obtain the temperature-dependent $\alpha$-helix propensities of all 20 naturally occurring residues with two recent additive force fields, Amber ff03w and Amber ff99SB(∗). Encouragingly, we find that the overall helix propensity of many residues is captured well by both energy functions, with Amber ff99SB(∗) being more accurate. Nonetheless, there are some residues that deviate considerably from experiment, which can be attributed to two aspects of the energy function: i), variations of the charge model used to determine the atomic partial charges, with residues whose backbone charges differ most from alanine tending to have the largest error; ii), side-chain torsion potentials, as illustrated by the effect of modifications to the torsion angles of I, L, D, N. We find that constrained refitting of residue charges for charged residues in Amber ff99SB(∗) significantly improves their helix propensity. The resulting parameters should more faithfully reproduce helix propensities in simulations of protein folding and disordered proteins.},

In this work, helix initiation was directly measured via ultrafast temperature-jump spectroscopy on the smallest possible helix nucleus for which only the first turn is formed. The rate's dependence on sequence, length, and temperature reveals the fastest possible events in protein folding dynamics, and it was possible to separate the rate-limiting torsional (conformational) diffusion from the fast annealing of the helix. An analytic coarse-grained model for this process, which predicts the initiation rate as a function of temperature, confirms this picture. Moreover, the stipulations of the model were verified by ensemble-converging all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, which reproduced both the picosecond annealing and the nanosecond diffusion processes observed experimentally.},

The rate of -helix nucleation in two polyalanine-based peptides and in lysine and glutamic acid homopolymers was measured directly by stopped-flow deep UV CD with synchrotron radiation as the light source. Synchrotron radiation CD gives far superior signal to noise than a conventional instrument. The 16-aa AK peptide folds with first-order kinetics and a rate constant of 15 s-1 at 0{\{}degrees{\}}C. The rate-determining step is presumably the initiation of a new helix, which occurs at least 105 times slower than expected. Helix folding occurs in at least two steps on the millisecond time scale for the longer peptides, with a transient overshoot of helix content significantly greater than at equilibrium, similar to that seen in the folding of several proteins. We suggest that the overshoot is caused by the formation of a single long helix followed by its breakage into the two or more helices present at equilibrium.},

abstract = {The nucleation event in $\alpha$-helix formation is a fundamental process in protein folding. However, determining how quickly it takes place based on measurements of the relaxation dynamics of helical peptides is difficult because such relaxations invariably contain contributions from various structural transitions such as from helical to nonhelical states and helical to partial-helical conformations. Herein, we measure the temperature-jump (T-jump) relaxation kinetics of three model peptides that fold into a single-turn $\alpha$-helix, using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, aiming to provide a direct assessment of the helix nucleation rate. The $\alpha$-helical structure of these peptides is stabilized by a covalent cross-linker formed between the side chains of two residues at the i and i + 4 positions. If we assume that this cross-linker mimics the structural constraint arising from a strong side chain-side chain interaction (e.g., a salt bridge) in proteins, these peptides would represent good models for studying the nucleation process of an $\alpha$-helix in a protein environment. Indeed, we find that the T-jump induced relaxation rate of these peptides is approximately (0.6 $\mu$s)(-1) at room temperature, which is slower than that of commonly studied alanine-based helical peptides but faster than that of a naturally occurring $\alpha$-helix whose folded state is stabilized by a series of side chain-side chain interactions. Taken together, our results put an upper limit of about 1 $\mu$s for the helix nucleation time at 20 °C and suggest that the subsequent propagation steps occur with a time constant of about 240 ns.},

abstract = {Experimental evidence and theoretical models both suggest that protein folding begins by specific short regions of the polypeptide chain intermittently assuming conformations close to their final ones. The independent folding properties and small size of these folding initiation sites make them suitable subjects for computational methods aimed at deriving structure from sequence. We have used a torsion space Monte Carlo procedure together with an all-atom free energy function to investigate the folding of a set of such sites. The free energy function is derived by a potential of mean force analysis of experimental protein structures. The most important contributions to the total free energy are the local main chain electrostatics, main chain hydrogen bonds, and the burial of nonpolar area. Six proposed independent folding units and four control peptides 11-14 residues long have been investigated. Thirty Monte Carlo simulations were performed on each peptide, starting from different random conformations. Five of the six folding units adopted conformations close to the experimental ones in some of the runs. None of the controls did so, as expected. The generated conformations which are close to the experimental ones have among the lowest free energies encountered, although some less native like low free energy conformations were also found. The effectiveness of the method on these peptides, which have a wide variety of experimental conformations, is encouraging in two ways: First, it provides independent evidence that these regions of the sequences are able to adopt native like conformations early in folding, and therefore are most probably key components of the folding pathways. Second, it demonstrates that available simulation methods and free energy functions are able to produce reasonably accurate structures. Extensions of the methods to the folding of larger portions of proteins are suggested.},

abstract = {Methods predicting protein secondary structure improved substantially in the 1990s through the use of evolutionary information taken from the divergence of proteins in the same structural family. Recently, the evolutionary information resulting from improved searches and larger databases has again boosted prediction accuracy by more than four percentage points to its current height of around 76{\%} of all residues predicted correctly in one of the three states, helix, strand, and other. The past year also brought successful new concepts to the field. These new methods may be particularly interesting in light of the improvements achieved through simple combining of existing methods. Divergent evolutionary profiles contain enough information not only to substantially improve prediction accuracy, but also to correctly predict long stretches of identical residues observed in alternative secondary structure states depending on nonlocal conditions. An example is a method automatically identifying structural switches and thus finding a remarkable connection between predicted secondary structure and aspects of function. Secondary structure predictions are increasingly becoming the work horse for numerous methods aimed at predicting protein structure and function. Is the recent increase in accuracy significant enough to make predictions even more useful? Because the recent improvement yields a better prediction of segments, and in particular of beta strands, I believe the answer is affirmative. What is the limit of prediction accuracy?

abstract = {The folding and unfolding kinetics of the B-domain of staphylococcal protein A, a small three-helix bundle protein, were probed by NMR. The lineshape of a single histidine resonance was fit as a function of denaturant to give folding and unfolding rate constants. The B-domain folds extremely rapidly in a two-state manner, with a folding rate constant of 120,000 s-1, making it one of the fastest-folding proteins known. Diffusion-collision theory predicts folding and unfolding rate constants that are in good agreement with the experimental values. The apparent rate constant as a function of denaturant ('chevron plot') is predicted within an order of magnitude. Our results are consistent with a model whereby fast-folding proteins utilize a diffusion-collision mechanism, with the preorganization of one or more elements of secondary structure in the unfolded protein.},

@article{Martin2005,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: A number of methods are now available to perform automatic assignment of periodic secondary structures from atomic coordinates, based on different characteristics of the secondary structures. In general these methods exhibit a broad consensus as to the location of most helix and strand core segments in protein structures. However the termini of the segments are often ill-defined and it is difficult to decide unambiguously which residues at the edge of the segments have to be included. In addition, there is a "twilight zone" where secondary structure segments depart significantly from the idealized models of Pauling and Corey. For these segments, one has to decide whether the observed structural variations are merely distorsions or whether they constitute a break in the secondary structure.

METHODS: To address these problems, we have developed a method for secondary structure assignment, called KAKSI. Assignments made by KAKSI are compared with assignments given by DSSP, STRIDE, XTLSSTR, PSEA and SECSTR, as well as secondary structures found in PDB files, on 4 datasets (X-ray structures with different resolution range, NMR structures).

RESULTS: A detailed comparison of KAKSI assignments with those of STRIDE and PSEA reveals that KAKSI assigns slightly longer helices and strands than STRIDE in case of one-to-one correspondence between the segments. However, KAKSI tends also to favor the assignment of several short helices when STRIDE and PSEA assign longer, kinked, helices. Helices assigned by KAKSI have geometrical characteristics close to those described in the PDB. They are more linear than helices assigned by other methods. The same tendency to split long segments is observed for strands, although less systematically. We present a number of cases of secondary structure assignments that illustrate this behavior.

CONCLUSION: Our method provides valuable assignments which favor the regularity of secondary structure segments.},

abstract = {The importance of thorough analyses of the secondary structures in proteins as basic structural units cannot be overemphasized. Although recent computational methods have achieved reasonably high accuracy for predicting secondary structures from amino acid sequences, a simple and fundamental empirical approach to characterize the amino acid composition of secondary structures was performed mainly in 1970s, with a small number of analyzed structures. To extend this classical approach using a large number of analyzed structures, here we characterized the amino acid sequences of secondary structures (12 154 alpha-helix units, 4592 3(10)-helix units, 16 787 beta-strand units, and 30 811 "other" units), using the representative three-dimensional protein structure records (1641 protein chains) from the Protein Data Bank. We first examined the length and the amino acid compositions of secondary structures, including rank order differences and assignment relationships among amino acids. These compositional results were largely, but not entirely, consistent with the previous studies. In addition, we examined the frequency of 400 amino acid doublets and 8000 triplets in secondary structures based on their relative counts, termed the availability. We identified not only some triplets that were specific to a certain secondary structure but also so-called zero-count triplets, which did not occur in a given secondary structure at all, even though they were probabilistically predicted to occur several times. Taken together, the present study revealed essential features of secondary structures and suggests potential applications in the secondary structure prediction and the functional design of protein sequences.},

Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications.

abstract = {Understanding molecular kinetics, and particularly protein folding, is a classic grand challenge in molecular biophysics. Network models, such as Markov state models (MSMs), are one potential solution to this problem. MSMs have recently yielded quantitative agreement with experimentally derived structures and folding rates for specific systems, leaving them positioned to potentially provide a deeper understanding of molecular kinetics that can lead to experimentally testable hypotheses. Here we use existing MSMs for the villin headpiece and NTL9, which were constructed from atomistic simulations, to accomplish this goal. In addition, we provide simpler, humanly comprehensible networks that capture the essence of molecular kinetics and reproduce qualitative phenomena like the apparent two-state folding often seen in experiments. Together, these models show that protein dynamics are dominated by stochastic jumps between numerous metastable states and that proteins have heterogeneous unfolded states (many unfolded basins that interconvert more rapidly with the native state than with one another) yet often still appear two-state. Most importantly, we find that protein native states are hubs that can be reached quickly from any other state. However, metastability and a web of nonnative states slow the average folding rate. Experimental tests for these findings and their implications for other fields, like protein design, are also discussed.},

(iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days. What began as three questions of basic science one half-century ago has now grown into the full-fledged research field of protein physical science.},

abstract = {The analysis of protein structure using secondary structure line segments has been widely used in many structure analysis and prediction methods over the past 20 years. Its use in methods that compare protein structures at this level of representation is becoming more important as an increasing number of protein structures become determined through structural genomic programmes. The standard method used to define line segments is to fit an axis through each secondary structure element. This approach has difficulties, however, both with inconsistent definitions of secondary structure and the problem of fitting a single straight line to a bent structure. The procedure described here avoids these problems by finding a set of line segments independently of any external secondary structure definition. This allows the segments to be used as a novel basis for secondary structure definition by taking the average rise/residue along each axis to characterise the segment. This practice has the advantage that secondary structures are described by a single (continuous) value that is not restricted to the conventional classes of alpha-helix, 310 and beta-strand. This latter property allows structures without "classic" secondary structures to be encoded as line segments that can be used in comparison algorithms. When compared over a large number of pairs of homologous proteins, the current method was found to be slightly more consistent than a widely used method based on hydrogen bonds.},

abstract = {A purely information theory-guided approach to quantitatively characterize protease specificity is established. We calculate an entropy value for each protease subpocket based on sequences of cleaved substrates extracted from the MEROPS database. We compare our results with known subpocket specificity profiles for individual proteases and protease groups (e.g. serine proteases, metallo proteases) and reflect them quantitatively. Summation of subpocket-wise cleavage entropy contributions yields a measure for overall protease substrate specificity. This total cleavage entropy allows ranking of different proteases with respect to their specificity, separating unspecific digestive enzymes showing high total cleavage entropy from specific proteases involved in signaling cascades. The development of a quantitative cleavage entropy score allows an unbiased comparison of subpocket-wise and overall protease specificity. Thus, it enables assessment of relative importance of physicochemical and structural descriptors in protease recognition. We present an exemplary application of cleavage entropy in tracing substrate specificity in protease evolution. This highlights the wide range of substrate promiscuity within homologue proteases and hence the heavy impact of a limited number of mutations on individual substrate specificity.},

Among them MMP-2 is one of the most relevant target in anticancer therapy. Commonly, MMP inhibitors contain a functional group able to bind the zinc ion and responsible for undesired side effects. The discovery of potent and selective MMP inhibitors not bearing a zinc-binding group is arising for some MMP family members and represents a new opportunity to find selective and non toxic inhibitors.In this work we attempted to get more insight on the inhibition process of MMP-2 by two non-zinc-binding inhibitors, applying a general protocol that combines several computational tools (docking, Molecular Dynamics and Quantum Chemical calculations), that all together contribute to rationalize experimental inhibition data. Molecular Dynamics studies showed both structural and mechanical-dynamical effects produced by the ligands not disclosed by docking analysis. Thermodynamic Integration provided relative binding free energies consistent with experimentally observed activity data. Quantum Chemical calculations of the tautomeric equilibrium involving the most active ligand completed the picture of the binding process. Our study highlights the crucial role of the specificity loop and suggests that enthalpic effect predominates over the entropic one.},

Although one can guess at the functions of these novel enzymes by considering sequence homology to known proteases, there is a need for new tools to rapidly provide functional information on large numbers of proteins. We describe a method for determining the cleavage site specificity of proteolytic enzymes that involves pooled sequencing of peptide library mixtures. The method was used to determine cleavage site motifs for six enzymes in the matrix metalloprotease (MMP) family. The results were validated by comparison with previous literature and by analyzing the cleavage of individually synthesized peptide substrates. The library data led us to identify the proteoglycan neurocan as a novel MMP-2 substrate. Our results indicate that a small set of libraries can be used to quickly profile an expanding protease family, providing information applicable to the design of inhibitors and to the identification of protein substrates.},

Using sequence and structure similarity networks to summarize the results, we constructed global views that show visually the relative abundance and variety of proteases in the degradome landscapes of these two species, and provide insights into evolutionary relationships between proteases. The results also indicate how broadly these sequence sets are covered by three-dimensional structures. These views facilitate cross-species comparisons and offer clues for drug design from knowledge about the sequences and structures of potential drug targets and their homologs. Two protease groups ("M32" and "C51") that are very different in sequence from human proteases are examined in structural detail, illustrating the application of this global approach in mining new pathogen genomes for potential drug targets. Based on our analyses, a human ACE2 inhibitor was selected for experimental testing on one of these parasite proteases, TbM32, and was shown to inhibit it. These sequence and structure data, along with interactive versions of the protein similarity networks generated in this study, are available at http://babbittlab.ucsf.edu/resources.html.},

abstract = {Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease. Novel chemotherapy with the drug K11777 targets the major cysteine protease cruzain and disrupts amastigote intracellular development. Nevertheless, the biological role of the protease in infection and pathogenesis remains unclear as cruzain gene knockout failed due to genetic redundancy. A role for the T. cruzi cysteine protease cruzain in immune evasion was elucidated in a comparative study of parental wild type- and cruzain-deficient parasites. Wild type T. cruzi did not activate host macrophages during early infection ({\textless}60 min) and no increase in ∼P i$\kappa$B was detected. The signaling factor NF-$\kappa$B P65 colocalized with cruzain on the cell surface of intracellular wild type parasites, and was proteolytically cleaved. No significant IL-12 expression occurred in macrophages infected with wild type T. cruzi and treated with LPS and BFA, confirming impairment of macrophage activation pathways. In contrast, cruzain-deficient parasites induced macrophage activation, detectable i$\kappa$B phosphorylation, and nuclear NF-$\kappa$B P65 localization. These parasites were unable to develop intracellularly and survive within macrophages. IL 12 expression levels in macrophages infected with cruzain-deficient T. cruzi were comparable to LPS activated controls. Thus cruzain hinders macrophage activation during the early ({\textless}60 min) stages of infection, by interruption of the NF-$\kappa$B P65 mediated signaling pathway. These early events allow T. cruzi survival and replication, and may lead to the spread of infection in acute Chagas' disease.},

abstract = {The obligate intracellular bacterial pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis injects numerous effector proteins into the epithelial cell cytoplasm to manipulate host functions important for bacterial survival. In addition, the bacterium secretes a serine protease, chlamydial protease-like activity factor (CPAF). Although several CPAF targets are reported, the significance of CPAF-mediated proteolysis is unclear due to the lack of specific CPAF inhibitors and the diversity of host targets. We report that CPAF also targets chlamydial effectors secreted early during the establishment of the pathogen-containing vacuole ("inclusion"). We designed a cell-permeable CPAF-specific inhibitory peptide and used it to determine that CPAF prevents superinfection by degrading early Chlamydia effectors translocated during entry into a preinfected cell. Prolonged CPAF inhibition leads to loss of inclusion integrity and caspase-1-dependent death of infected epithelial cells. Thus, CPAF functions in niche protection, inclusion integrity and pathogen survival, making the development of CPAF-specific protease inhibitors an attractive antichlamydial therapeutic strategy.},

abstract = {Bacteria in the genus Chlamydia are major human pathogens that cause an intracellular infection. A chlamydial protease, CPAF, has been proposed as an important virulence factor that cleaves or degrades at least 16 host proteins, thereby altering multiple cellular processes. We examined 11 published CPAF substrates and found that there was no detectable proteolysis when CPAF activity was inhibited during cell processing. We show that the reported proteolysis of these putative CPAF substrates was due to enzymatic activity in cell lysates rather than in intact cells. Nevertheless, Chlamydia-infected cells displayed Chlamydia-host interactions, such as Golgi reorganization, apoptosis resistance, and host cytoskeletal remodeling, that have been attributed to CPAF-dependent proteolysis of host proteins. Our findings suggest that other mechanisms may be responsible for these Chlamydia-host interactions, and raise concerns about all published CPAF substrates and the proposed roles of CPAF in chlamydial pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Helix formation is an elementary process in protein folding, influencing both the rate and mechanism of the global folding reaction. Yet, because helix formation is less cooperative than protein folding, the kinetics are often multiexponential, and the observed relaxation times are not straightforwardly related to the microscopic rates for helix nucleation and elongation. Recent ultrafast spectroscopic measurements on the peptide Ac-WAAAH(+)-NH(2) were best fit by two relaxation modes on the ∼0.1-1 ns time scale, (1) apparently much faster than had previously been experimentally inferred for helix nucleation. Here, we use replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations with an optimized all-atom protein force field (Amber ff03w) and an accurate water model (TIP4P/2005) to study the kinetics of helix formation in this peptide. We calculate temperature-dependent microscopic rate coefficients from the simulations by treating the dynamics between helical states as a Markov process using a recently developed formalism. The fluorescence relaxation curves obtained from simulated temperature jumps are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined results. We find that the kinetics are multiphasic but can be approximated well by a double-exponential function. The major processes contributing to the relaxation are the shrinking of helical states at the C-terminal end and a faster re-equilibration among coil states. Despite the fast observed relaxation, the helix nucleation time is estimated from our model to be 20-70 ns at 300 K, with a dependence on temperature well described by Arrhenius kinetics.},

In this work, helix initiation was directly measured via ultrafast temperature-jump spectroscopy on the smallest possible helix nucleus for which only the first turn is formed. The rate's dependence on sequence, length, and temperature reveals the fastest possible events in protein folding dynamics, and it was possible to separate the rate-limiting torsional (conformational) diffusion from the fast annealing of the helix. An analytic coarse-grained model for this process, which predicts the initiation rate as a function of temperature, confirms this picture. Moreover, the stipulations of the model were verified by ensemble-converging all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, which reproduced both the picosecond annealing and the nanosecond diffusion processes observed experimentally.},

abstract = {Gene expression, DNA replication and genome maintenance are all initiated by proteins that must recognize specific targets from among a vast excess of nonspecific DNA. For example, to initiate transcription, Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) must locate promoter sequences, which compose {\textless}2{\%} of the bacterial genome. This search problem remains one of the least understood aspects of gene expression, largely owing to the transient nature of search intermediates. Here we visualize RNAP in real time as it searches for promoters, and we develop a theoretical framework for analyzing target searches at the submicroscopic scale on the basis of single-molecule target-association rates. We demonstrate that, contrary to long-held assumptions, the promoter search is dominated by three-dimensional diffusion at both the microscopic and submicroscopic scales in vitro, which has direct implications for understanding how promoters are located within physiological settings.},

abstract = {The choice of codons can influence local translation kinetics during protein synthesis. Whether codon preference is linked to cotranslational regulation of polypeptide folding remains unclear. Here, we derive a revised translational efficiency scale that incorporates the competition between tRNA supply and demand. Applying this scale to ten closely related yeast species, we uncover the evolutionary conservation of codon optimality in eukaryotes. This analysis reveals universal patterns of conserved optimal and nonoptimal codons, often in clusters, which associate with the secondary structure of the translated polypeptides independent of the levels of expression. Our analysis suggests an evolved function for codon optimality in regulating the rhythm of elongation to facilitate cotranslational polypeptide folding, beyond its previously proposed role of adapting to the cost of expression. These findings establish how mRNA sequences are generally under selection to optimize the cotranslational folding of corresponding polypeptides.},

Here, we describe a computational method that estimates the extent of optimization for affinity and specificity of amino acids at a protein-DNA interface based on the crystal structure of the complex, by modeling the changes in binding-free energy associated with all individual amino acid and base substitutions at the interface. The extent to which residues are predicted to be optimal for specificity versus affinity varies within a given protein-DNA interface and between different complexes, and in many cases recapitulates previous experimental observations. The approach provides a complement to traditional methods of mutational analysis, and should be useful for rapidly formulating hypotheses about the roles of amino acid residues in protein-DNA interfaces.},

abstract = {The reprogramming of DNA-binding specificity is an important challenge for computational protein design that tests current understanding of protein-DNA recognition, and has considerable practical relevance for biotechnology and medicine. Here we describe the computational redesign of the cleavage specificity of the intron-encoded homing endonuclease I-MsoI using a physically realistic atomic-level forcefield. Using an in silico screen, we identified single base-pair substitutions predicted to disrupt binding by the wild-type enzyme, and then optimized the identities and conformations of clusters of amino acids around each of these unfavourable substitutions using Monte Carlo sampling. A redesigned enzyme that was predicted to display altered target site specificity, while maintaining wild-type binding affinity, was experimentally characterized. The redesigned enzyme binds and cleaves the redesigned recognition site approximately 10,000 times more effectively than does the wild-type enzyme, with a level of target discrimination comparable to the original endonuclease. Determination of the structure of the redesigned nuclease-recognition site complex by X-ray crystallography confirms the accuracy of the computationally predicted interface. These results suggest that computational protein design methods can have an important role in the creation of novel highly specific endonucleases for gene therapy and other applications.},

Here, we present a novel molecular modeling protocol for protein-DNA interfaces that borrows conformational sampling techniques from de novo protein structure prediction to generate a diverse ensemble of structural models from small fragments of related and unrelated protein-DNA complexes. The extensive conformational sampling is coupled with sequence space exploration so that binding preferences for the target protein can be inferred from the resulting optimized DNA sequences. We apply the algorithm to predict binding profiles for a benchmark set of eleven C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, five of known and six of unknown structure. The predicted profiles are in good agreement with experimental binding data; furthermore, examination of the modeled structures gives insight into observed binding preferences.},

The DNA-binding domains of transcription factors exhibit surprisingly diverse protein architectures, yet all achieve a precise complementarity of shape facilitating specific chemical recognition of their particular DNA targets. Although general rules for recognition can be derived, the complex nature of the recognition mechanism precludes a simple recognition code. In particular, it has become evident that the structure and flexibility of DNA and contacts mediated by water molecules contribute to the recognition process. Nevertheless, based on known structures it has proven possible to design proteins with novel recognition specificities. Despite this considerable practical success, the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of protein/DNA recognition remain poorly understood.},

Here, we present a novel molecular modeling protocol for protein-DNA interfaces that borrows conformational sampling techniques from de novo protein structure prediction to generate a diverse ensemble of structural models from small fragments of related and unrelated protein-DNA complexes. The extensive conformational sampling is coupled with sequence space exploration so that binding preferences for the target protein can be inferred from the resulting optimized DNA sequences. We apply the algorithm to predict binding profiles for a benchmark set of eleven C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors, five of known and six of unknown structure. The predicted profiles are in good agreement with experimental binding data; furthermore, examination of the modeled structures gives insight into observed binding preferences.},

abstract = {Structural data on protein-DNA complexes provide clues for understanding the mechanism of protein-DNA recognition. Although the structures of a large number of protein-DNA complexes are known, the mechanisms underlying their specific binding are still only poorly understood. Analysis of these structures has shown that there is no simple one-to-one correspondence between bases and amino acids within protein-DNA complexes; nevertheless, the observed patterns of interaction carry important information on the mechanisms of protein-DNA recognition. In this review, we show how the patterns of interaction, either observed in known structures or derived from computer simulations, confer recognition specificity, and how they can be used to examine the relationship between structure and specificity and to predict target DNA sequences used by regulatory proteins.},

abstract = {Flexible peptides that fold upon binding to another protein molecule mediate a large number of regulatory interactions in the living cell and may provide highly specific recognition modules. We present Rosetta FlexPepDock ab-initio, a protocol for simultaneous docking and de-novo folding of peptides, starting from an approximate specification of the peptide binding site. Using the Rosetta fragments library and a coarse-grained structural representation of the peptide and the receptor, FlexPepDock ab-initio samples efficiently and simultaneously the space of possible peptide backbone conformations and rigid-body orientations over the receptor surface of a given binding site. The subsequent all-atom refinement of the coarse-grained models includes full side-chain modeling of both the receptor and the peptide, resulting in high-resolution models in which key side-chain interactions are recapitulated. The protocol was applied to a benchmark in which peptides were modeled over receptors in either their bound backbone conformations or in their free, unbound form. Near-native peptide conformations were identified in 18/26 of the bound cases and 7/14 of the unbound cases. The protocol performs well on peptides from various classes of secondary structures, including coiled peptides with unusual turns and kinks. The results presented here significantly extend the scope of state-of-the-art methods for high-resolution peptide modeling, which can now be applied to a wide variety of peptide-protein interactions where no prior information about the peptide backbone conformation is available, enabling detailed structure-based studies and manipulation of those interactions.},

The process has four stages: 1) choice of a catalytic mechanism and corresponding minimal model active site, 2) identification of sites in a set of scaffold proteins where this minimal active site can be realized, 3) optimization of the identities of the surrounding residues for stabilizing interactions with the transition state and primary catalytic residues, and 4) evaluation and ranking the resulting designed sequences. Stages two through four of this process can be carried out with the Rosetta package, while stage one needs to be done externally.

Despite recent successes in high resolution structure modeling and design, the Rosetta software suite fares poorly on small protein and RNA puzzles, some as small as four residues. To illustrate these problems, this manuscript presents Rosetta results for four well-defined test cases: the 20-residue mini-protein Trp cage, an even smaller disulfide-stabilized conotoxin, the reactive loop of a serine protease inhibitor, and a UUCG RNA tetraloop. In contrast to previous Rosetta studies, several lines of evidence indicate that conformational sampling is not the major bottleneck in modeling these small systems. Instead, approximations and omissions in the Rosetta all-atom energy function currently preclude discriminating experimentally observed conformations from de novo models at atomic resolution. These molecular "puzzles" should serve as useful model systems for developers wishing to make foundational improvements to this powerful modeling suite.},

abstract = {Some protein design tasks cannot be modeled by the traditional single state design strategy of finding a sequence that is optimal for a single fixed backbone. Such cases require multistate design, where a single sequence is threaded onto multiple backbones (states) and evaluated for its strengths and weaknesses on each backbone. For example, to design a protein that can switch between two specific conformations, it is necessary to to find a sequence that is compatible with both backbone conformations. We present in this paper a generic implementation of multistate design that is suited for a wide range of protein design tasks and demonstrate in silico its capabilities at two design tasks: one of redesigning an obligate homodimer into an obligate heterodimer such that the new monomers would not homodimerize, and one of redesigning a promiscuous interface to bind to only a single partner and to no longer bind the rest of its partners. Both tasks contained negative design in that multistate design was asked to find sequences that would produce high energies for several of the states being modeled. Success at negative design was assessed by computationally redocking the undesired protein-pair interactions; we found that multistate design's accuracy improved as the diversity of conformations for the undesired protein-pair interactions increased. The paper concludes with a discussion of the pitfalls of negative design, which has proven considerably more challenging than positive design.},

abstract = {Predicting the set of sequences that are tolerated by a protein or protein interface, while maintaining a desired function, is useful for characterizing protein interaction specificity and for computationally designing sequence libraries to engineer proteins with new functions. Here we provide a general method, a detailed set of protocols, and several benchmarks and analyses for estimating tolerated sequences using flexible backbone protein design implemented in the Rosetta molecular modeling software suite. The input to the method is at least one experimentally determined three-dimensional protein structure or high-quality model. The starting structure(s) are expanded or refined into a conformational ensemble using Monte Carlo simulations consisting of backrub backbone and side chain moves in Rosetta. The method then uses a combination of simulated annealing and genetic algorithm optimization methods to enrich for low-energy sequences for the individual members of the ensemble. To emphasize certain functional requirements (e.g. forming a binding interface), interactions between and within parts of the structure (e.g. domains) can be reweighted in the scoring function. Results from each backbone structure are merged together to create a single estimate for the tolerated sequence space. We provide an extensive description of the protocol and its parameters, all source code, example analysis scripts and three tests applying this method to finding sequences predicted to stabilize proteins or protein interfaces. The generality of this method makes many other applications possible, for example stabilizing interactions with small molecules, DNA, or RNA. Through the use of within-domain reweighting and/or multistate design, it may also be possible to use this method to find sequences that stabilize particular protein conformations or binding interactions over others.},

abstract = {Protein structure prediction methods such as Rosetta search for the lowest energy conformation of the polypeptide chain. However, the experimentally observed native state is at a minimum of the free energy, rather than the energy. The neglect of the missing configurational entropy contribution to the free energy can be partially justified by the assumption that the entropies of alternative folded states, while very much less than unfolded states, are not too different from one another, and hence can be to a first approximation neglected when searching for the lowest free energy state. The shortcomings of current structure prediction methods may be due in part to the breakdown of this assumption. Particularly problematic are proteins with significant disordered regions which do not populate single low energy conformations even in the native state. We describe two approaches within the Rosetta structure modeling methodology for treating such regions. The first does not require advance knowledge of the regions likely to be disordered; instead these are identified by minimizing a simple free energy function used previously to model protein folding landscapes and transition states. In this model, residues can be either completely ordered or completely disordered; they are considered disordered if the gain in entropy outweighs the loss of favorable energetic interactions with the rest of the protein chain. The second approach requires identification in advance of the disordered regions either from sequence alone using for example the DISOPRED server or from experimental data such as NMR chemical shifts. During Rosetta structure prediction calculations the disordered regions make only unfavorable repulsive contributions to the total energy.

abstract = {RosettaDock has been increasingly used in protein docking and design strategies in order to predict the structure of protein-protein interfaces. Here we test capabilities of RosettaDock 3.2, part of the newly developed Rosetta v3.2 modeling suite, against Docking Benchmark 3.0, and compare it with RosettaDock v2.3, the latest version of the previous Rosetta software package. The benchmark contains a diverse set of 116 docking targets including 22 antibody-antigen complexes, 33 enzyme-inhibitor complexes, and 60 other complexes. These targets were further classified by expected docking difficulty into 84 rigid-body targets, 17 medium targets, and 14 difficult targets. We carried out local docking perturbations for each target, using the unbound structures when available, in both RosettaDock v2.3 and v3.2. Overall the performances of RosettaDock v2.3 and v3.2 were similar. RosettaDock v3.2 achieved 56 docking funnels, compared to 49 in v2.3. A breakdown of docking performance by protein complex type shows that RosettaDock v3.2 achieved docking funnels for 63{\%} of antibody-antigen targets, 62{\%} of enzyme-inhibitor targets, and 35{\%} of other targets. In terms of docking difficulty, RosettaDock v3.2 achieved funnels for 58{\%} of rigid-body targets, 30{\%} of medium targets, and 14{\%} of difficult targets. For targets that failed, we carry out additional analyses to identify the cause of failure, which showed that binding-induced backbone conformation changes account for a majority of failures.

Finally, we demonstrate the additional functionality available in RosettaDock v3.2 by incorporating small-molecules and non-protein co-factors in docking of a smaller target set. This study marks the most extensive benchmarking of the RosettaDock module to date and establishes a baseline for future research in protein interface modeling and structure prediction.},

abstract = {Computational structure prediction and design of proteins and protein-protein complexes have long been inaccessible to those not directly involved in the field. A key missing component has been the ability to visualize the progress of calculations to better understand them. Rosetta is one simulation suite that would benefit from a robust real-time visualization solution. Several tools exist for the sole purpose of visualizing biomolecules; one of the most popular tools, PyMOL (Schr{\"{o}}dinger), is a powerful, highly extensible, user friendly, and attractive package. Integrating Rosetta and PyMOL directly has many technical and logistical obstacles inhibiting usage. To circumvent these issues, we developed a novel solution based on transmitting biomolecular structure and energy information via UDP sockets. Rosetta and PyMOL run as separate processes, thereby avoiding many technical obstacles while visualizing information on-demand in real-time. When Rosetta detects changes in the structure of a protein, new coordinates are sent over a UDP network socket to a PyMOL instance running a UDP socket listener. PyMOL then interprets and displays the molecule. This implementation also allows remote execution of Rosetta. When combined with PyRosetta, this visualization solution provides an interactive environment for protein structure prediction and design.},

Here we describe an in silico method that uses Rosetta and machine learning techniques to predict a highly accurate "top 5" list of ts mutations given the structure of a protein of interest. Rosetta is a protein structure prediction and design code, used here to model and score how proteins accommodate point mutations with side-chain and backbone movements.

At their core these methods rely on a similar hybrid energy function, composed of physics-based and database-derived terms, while different sequence and conformational sampling approaches are used for each design category. Although these are first steps for the computational design of novel function, crystal structures and biochemical characterization already point out where success and failure are likely in the application of protein design. Contrasting failed and successful design attempts have been used to diagnose deficiencies in the approaches and in the underlying hybrid energy function. In this manner, design provides an inherent mechanism by which crucial information is obtained on pressing areas where focused efforts to improve methods are needed. Of the successful designs, many feature pre-organized sites that are poised to perform their intended function, and improvements often result from disfavoring alternative functionally suboptimal states. These rapid developments and fundamental insights obtained thus far promise to make computational design of novel molecular function general, robust, and routine.},

Here, we describe a molecular modeling study of MHC-peptide interactions that integrates sampling techniques from protein-protein docking, loop modeling, de novo structure prediction, and protein design in order to construct atomically detailed peptide binding landscapes for a diverse set of MHC proteins. Specificity profiles derived from these landscapes recover key features of experimental binding profiles and can be used to predict peptide binding with reasonable accuracy. Family wide comparison of the predicted binding landscapes recapitulates previously reported patterns of specificity divergence and peptide-repertoire diversity while providing a structural basis for observed specificity patterns. The size and sequence diversity of these structure-based binding landscapes enable us to identify subtle patterns of covariation between peptide sequence positions; analysis of the associated structural models suggests physical interactions that may mediate these sequence correlations.},

After affinity maturation, two of the designed proteins, HB36 and HB80, bind H1 and H5 HAs with low nanomolar affinity. Further, HB80 inhibits the HA fusogenic conformational changes induced at low pH. The crystal structure of HB36 in complex with 1918/H1 HA revealed that the actual binding interface is nearly identical to that in the computational design model.

(iii) Can we devise a computer algorithm to predict protein structures from their sequences? We review progress on these problems. In a few cases, computer simulations of the physical forces in chemically detailed models have now achieved the accurate folding of small proteins. We have learned that proteins fold rapidly because random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward the native structure, a principle that is captured in funnel-shaped energy landscapes. And thanks in part to the large Protein Data Bank of known structures, predicting protein structures is now far more successful than was thought possible in the early days. What began as three questions of basic science one half-century ago has now grown into the full-fledged research field of protein physical science.},

abstract = {Protein crystals have catalytic and materials applications and are central to efforts in structural biology and therapeutic development. Designing predetermined crystal structures can be subtle given the complexity of proteins and the noncovalent interactions that govern crystallization. De novo protein design provides an approach to engineer highly complex nanoscale molecular structures, and often the positions of atoms can be programmed with sub-Å precision. Herein, a computational approach is presented for the design of proteins that self-assemble in three dimensions to yield macroscopic crystals. A three-helix coiled-coil protein is designed de novo to form a polar, layered, three-dimensional crystal having the P6 space group, which has a "honeycomb-like" structure and hexameric channels that span the crystal. The approach involves: (i) creating an ensemble of crystalline structures consistent with the targeted symmetry; (ii) characterizing this ensemble to identify "designable" structures from minima in the sequence-structure energy landscape and designing sequences for these structures; (iii) experimentally characterizing candidate proteins. A 2.1 Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of one such designed protein exhibits sub-Å agreement [backbone root mean square deviation (rmsd)] with the computational model of the crystal. This approach to crystal design has potential applications to the de novo design of nanostructured materials and to the modification of natural proteins to facilitate X-ray crystallographic analysis.},

abstract = {Interactions between proteins are orchestrated in a precise and time-dependent manner, underlying cellular function. The binding affinity, defined as the strength of these interactions, is translated into physico-chemical terms in the dissociation constant (Kd), the latter being an experimental measure that determines whether an interaction will be formed in solution or not. Predicting binding affinity from structural models has been a matter of active research for more than 40 years because of its fundamental role in drug development. However, all available approaches are incapable of predicting the binding affinity of protein-protein complexes from coordinates alone. Here, we examine both theoretical and experimental limitations that complicate the derivation of structure-affinity relationships. Most work so far has concentrated on binary interactions. Systems of increased complexity are far from being understood. The main physico-chemical measure that relates to binding affinity is the buried surface area, but it does not hold for flexible complexes. For the latter, there must be a significant entropic contribution that will have to be approximated in the future. We foresee that any theoretical modelling of these interactions will have to follow an integrative approach considering the biology, chemistry and physics that underlie protein-protein recognition.},

@article{Stranges2011,
abstract = {Computational design of novel protein-protein interfaces is a test of our understanding of protein interactions and has the potential to allow modification of cellular physiology. Methods for designing high-affinity interactions that adopt a predetermined binding mode have proved elusive, suggesting the need for new strategies that simplify the design process. A solvent-exposed backbone on a $\beta$-strand is thought of as "sticky" and $\beta$-strand pairing stabilizes many naturally occurring protein complexes. Here, we computationally redesign a monomeric protein to form a symmetric homodimer by pairing exposed $\beta$-strands to form an intermolecular $\beta$-sheet. A crystal structure of the designed complex closely matches the computational model (rmsd = 1.0 Å). This work demonstrates that $\beta$-strand pairing can be used to computationally design new interactions with high accuracy.},

abstract = {Ten years after the publication of the position paper The hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg Cell 100:5770, 2000), it has become increasingly clear that mutated cells on their way to giving rise to a tumor have also to learn how to thrive in a chronically inflamed microenvironment, evade immune recognition, and suppress immune reactivity. Genetic and molecular definition of these three immune hallmarks of cancer offers the opportunity to learn how to deploy specific countermeasures to reverse the situation in favor of the immune system and, eventually, the patient. This new information could be channeled to address what seem to be the three major hallmarks for the immune control of cancer progression: effective procedures to activate immune reactivity; characterization of not-disposable oncoantigens; and counteraction of immune suppression.},

@article{Ioannidis2007,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

In this article we illustrate some basic features of error bars and explain how they can help communicate data and assist correct interpretation. Error bars may show confidence intervals, standard errors, standard deviations, or other quantities. Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent. We suggest eight simple rules to assist with effective use and interpretation of error bars.},

abstract = {DNA sequence represents a single format onto which a broad range of biological phenomena can be projected for high-throughput data collection. Over the past three years, massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms have become widely available, reducing the cost of DNA sequencing by over two orders of magnitude, and democratizing the field by putting the sequencing capacity of a major genome center in the hands of individual investigators. These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design. Next-generation DNA sequencing has the potential to dramatically accelerate biological and biomedical research, by enabling the comprehensive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and interactomes to become inexpensive, routine and widespread, rather than requiring significant production-scale efforts.},
